Cristi_Ciopron,8,0,0,14-Sep-08," A biopic of gusto
","This tale of great gusto and assured instinct belongs to any top 10 of modern musician/ musical biopics (I have in mind an Avati biopic of a jazz-man, the Mann flick with Stewart Â…)Â—maybe indeed to any show artists biopics top 10. Visually, dramatically it is valid, and so are the performances. Anyone who fears the ugly touches of the postmodern stupidity may rest assured there are none here. It is an author movie, written with obvious interest in the subjectÂ—a wholesome tribute. The puzzle structure may be debatable, yet it does not work against the movie's main merits. It spares us the fashionable revisionism. I would of asked a more logical sequence, a more detailed and explicit reportÂ—yet the biopic here aims at giving rather, within an impressionistic frame, a few very suggestive scenes and snapshots, it prefers to explore several choice moments. The impressionistic approach is a little selfÂ—indulgent, and one would have liked if this was brought closer to a logic coherence in chronology.Edith's life as narrated in LA MÃ”ME has the disconcerting aspect of real livesÂ—a seemingly chaotic succession of ups and downsÂ—especially dramatic in her own case. As with other biopics, it breaks the convention of conclusiveness, as no particular lesson, say, is to be derived from it. The point is that the reflection upon such a life carefully rendered is the aim in itself. As her death nears, Edith contemplates her life and seems to find a secret meaning in it. As a footnote, comparing the ages, I felt Mrs. Dietrich was shown a little too old when she has met Edith.In biopics there is a strong deviceÂ—alternating scenes of intimacy, of _intimismÂ—and of socialityÂ—showing the main character cast into an exterior world, almost unrecognizable. This alternation works very well in the Mme. Cotillard film.In a few scenes, Mme. Cotillard is amazingly beautiful and warm. The images of happiness and grief and grotesque are succinctly seized.The director wished for his biopic a beautiful form, a visually, musically charming feastÂ—hence the festive airÂ—and in keeping with the narration's shape, in harmony, without betraying the content. The vignettes are drawn with a sure hand, with virile precision. The acts of life are presented Â–or merely suggestedÂ—with naturalness, without tasteless indiscretion. One can not fail to see that, in a way, LA MOME is reminding the movies of Edith's youthÂ—the French poetic realism. It's a movie made in the French poetic realism's key. (On the other hand, this approach only partially covers the biopic's intentions and form.) With his impressionism, the director shows a remarkable tactÂ—in choosing his scenes, in unveiling without over-stressing, in refusing the concessions to modern murkiness and pointlessness (the flick I had seen before this was a Scorsese oneÂ—CASINOÂ—the contrast is telling). His tale has verve and brio and a visual charm. He has the courage and instinct of creatingÂ—even in a documentary , presenting a character means creating, recreating him, choosing, synthesizing, intimating it, opting for a fundamental intuition. Fidelity to history means an option, a visionÂ—creation.",La Vie En Rose 2007.csv

","The Usual Suspects is hands down one of the best movies ever. It is one of those movies where you don't realize what you've seen until the end. The story is flawless and leaves you on the edge of your seat, which explains why it won a best original screenplay Oscar. The film is Directed by Bryan Singer (in his second picture).The usual suspects has great ensemble cast. However, the one that shines the most is Kevin Spacey(who won a best supporting actor Oscar for the role)Spacey plays the cripple Verbal Kintwho is the only survivor of the boat incident. The film is told through the verbals flashbacks. Verbal flashbacks tell the story of 5 criminals who meet in a line up, which they think was no coincidence. The 5 criminals decide to pull a couple cons together, but when a they learn that a under ground drug-lord could be pulling the strings things start going terribly wrong.The one thing I don't understand is why this movie did not get nominated for a best picture or director academy award.

","Besides the less then stelar opinion of mankind presented, the movie has nothing to offer. The most egregious insult is the fact that the stupid woman that went out into the mist that killed everyone because her kids were alone made it out safe. HOW? By some magic that protects idiots who think kids are the most extra special thing ever? Garbage. And how did everyone not realize they were dealing with animals from somewhere else? It seemed pretty clear that the mist was the atmosphere they needed, so if they worked on getting rid of the mist itself, maybe they would have made it. Also, the idea that religious people crack up is old. And boring. I bet most religious people would stay logical and good natured longer then some liberal kiddie.

kattnerellen,10,1,1,23-Feb-17," An excellent dream come true
","Enchanted: A Fairytale Brought to Life With its ten year anniversary just around the corner, Enchanted continues to spark the imagination of children and parents alike. This movie is able to create a bridge between fantasy and reality, connecting them in a way that reconfigures previous fairy tales. Not only is this film a classic for the whole family, it's also a wonderland full of fruit for the imagination.Amy Adams, who portrays Giselle, does a phenomenal job of portraying an animated character brought to life. She comes from an animated fairytale world where she is living a fantasy, and she carries that mindset through her transition to New York City. Her emotions lead you on this journey of experiencing life for what seems to be the first time. She is able to separate her character into two different identities and then ties them together in the end. Patrick Dempsey, who portrays Robert Phillip, is the charming knight in shiny armor that comes to rescue Gisele from the streets of New York in the beginning of the movie. He is able to captivate the reality of a hero, beyond the glorified fairytale version. Together Adams and Dempsey create a platform in which they continue to build up and the whole time they are drawing in the audience with their chemistry and emotional connection.The music is what bring the movie to life. It's playful and entertaining while telling an important story. The songs mostly speak of love and the person you're meant to be with for the rest of your life, very fitting for a fairytale. The meaning of the lyrics progress from fairytale to reality as the movie continues. Starting with dreaming of a true loves kiss all the way to loving someone you can't have. It's a powerful progression which enhances how the audience feels, how I felt. Adams does an excellent job singing and performing with great vocals and exceptional dance moves. The performance of ""That's how you know"" is a joyful one which brings all the people of New York together to sing about love and telling the girl of your dreams how you feel. It's exciting and by the end of the song you'll be trying to sing along.Another element which progresses throughout the movie is Giselle's costume designs. They begin as poufy, clichÃ© fairytale ball gowns and slowly slim down into an end product of a tightly fitted, mermaid style gown. These dresses directly tie into the different stages of Giselle's journey to reality and greatly highlights that. They were bright and elegant and made Giselle the center of attention at all times.Enchanted is a must-see movie with a charming spin on a classic fairytale, making it into something people can relate to. This is not only impressive but captivating. The emotional and joyous acting of Adams and Dempsey, the reconfigured classic fairytale plot, stunning outfits and the perfect music all come together to evoke the idea that fairy tales really do come true. It leaves the audience with hope that they could one day walk alongside a princess on the streets of New York.",Enchanted 2007.csv

","Just watched ""Bull Durham"" again for maybe the sixth or seventh time, and I have more respect for it now than ever. The Special Edition DVD is the perfect way to preserve Ron Shelton's funny, sexy, passionate, action-filled baseball masterpiece.Movies aimed at grown-ups are a rarity, which may be why ""Bull Durham"" still feels like such an amazing movie. Not a moment of it is aimed toward the lowest common denominator. There is sex in this movie, and talk of sex, but it's not silly or gutter-minded, and never gross. You can feel the physical and emotional passion of the characters; baseball simply provides the philosophical backdrop behind the romance -- the reason the characters are together.Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon make my favorite romantic screen couple; they burn up the screen. Costner in particular is excellent, showing a knack for verbal comedy and physical heroism that he put on a shelf until ""Tin Cup."" And Tim Robbins turns in a memorable performance as Nuke Laloosh.I see no reason in going into the plot details, as everyone who has seen the film knows what ""Bull Durham"" is about, and those who haven't seen it are in for a wonderful treat. Few movies approach perfection, but this one, set in a world of lovable losers where the game is just as much a job as selling appliances at Sears, joins that select handful.",Bull Durham 1988.csv

","If you see the trailer it's very obvious and predictable how it's going to all play out. It's a decent movie but if the build up was a bit better and had more inspiring and bonding elements going for it. The finale would have stood out more. The story is about a high school teacher named Scott Voss played by Kevin James. Who usually gets these likable character that has a good heart. In this he is basically a lazy nice guy practically. And when the school is having budget cuts and laying off good teachers. He decides to find a way to raise the money and to impress another teacher that he has the hots for. And to raise the money he decides to fight in MMA tournaments. So it goes in a predictable direction of him training, getting better at what he does, building a reputation and inspiring his students. Now this is a fast paced movie and the development isn't done all that well to the point it leaves a big impact at the end. Bas Rutten is also in this as Voss's trainer and he is great in this.5/10",Here Comes the Boom 2012.csv

","As much as I loved the novel ""The Martian"" by Andy Weir, I'm unimpressed by its cinematic adaptation. The story in the book is all about details: the amount of credible technical information offered in the original novel every time Watney (the astronaut stranded on Mars) has a new idea to survive on Mars is the very backbone of the story and its defining style.Unfortunately, when you have to adapt such kind of material to the big screen, you must remove most of the technicalities, otherwise people would fell asleep in theaters. Ridley Scott made a good film, supported by decent acting and visuals. But the geekish flavor of the book, which makes it great and unique, is almost totally lost.

Movie Nuttball,10,1,3,06-Jul-03," The sequel has finally come! Theatrecal & video comments below!
","I saw Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines on the 4th of July 2003 and on the same night I saw The Hulk!It was an excellent experience seeing both blockbusters right after the other!It was well worth it and a unique way to spend on Independence Day!As a very big fan of the Terminator series this was a must see!The first one was dark movie and the second film was extraordinary and epic.The third one believe it or not I really can't say.Maybe it because I haven't seen this one a few dozen times like T2 but the movie just didn't seem or feel as epic.It didn't have that specialness the Judgment Day had that it was so perfect that you could cry feel.Sure it was an extremely entertaining movie as the action scenes in the new film were spectacular and some of biggest and greatest action scenes to date.The movie had some humor in it and other scenes were similar like the other two.As for the characters.Since Arnold's T-850 is different that the other Terminator he acted as if he really was different.His looks stayed about the same but with different guns and even a some what different attitude.The new villain the T-X or Terminatrix played by Kristanna Loken was a phenomenal character!She was the perfect choice to play the bad Terminator and she is much,much more power than the T-850.I don't want spoil what she can do but she can do just about anything!I really like the actress who plays her.She is a very neat looking young woman and I would love to see here in more action films.As for Claire Danes she played her part very well and yes I like her looks too just in case your curious.Nick Stahl was good and the way he played a older John Connor made it seem real.Earl Boen returns as Dr. Peter Silberman for a very brief moment and his role in this film was surprising.Unlike the beginning of T2 this beginning with the Endoskeletons looked all CGI but yet it looked great!Brad Fiedel is gone form the movie but Marco Beltrami's score is just as decent and even though the beautiful Terminator theme is gone until the end credits Beltrami has his own score! James Cameron is out and Jonathan Mostow is in.Mostow actually pulled it off!His direction was very good and I think the project was directed right.How Cameron would have directed and handled this new Terminator movie is unknown.I do hope there will be a sequel with the same cast.I think what I said above about it not being special is because I only saw it once.Overall it had plenty of fights between the Terminators and in the action scenes there was so much damage with chase scenes and it was never boring that I think it should satisfy most Terminator fans and even if your not a Terminator fan but love Arnold and action movies I think you should give this a look! I strongly recommend it!I bought the movie Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and in My opinion its is just as good and action packed as the other two. This one has a whole bunch of incredible action! Arnold was great! Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were good! I really liked Danes! Kristanna Loken was awesome as the T-X Terminatrix! She was the perfect choice to play this great villain! I hope to see this awesome looking woman in more action films in the near future! David Andrews and Earl Boen were good. The music by Marco Beltrami is excellent an is arguably the greatest score ever composed in My opinion! If you like Arnold and the other Terminator films and have not seen this movie then don't rent but buy this immediately because I strongly recommend it!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:Watch the the end credits for the original Terminator theme performed by Marco Beltrami! Also plays the cool song called ""The Current"" performed by The Blue Man Group featuring Gavin Rossdale! Its an excellent song!",Terminator 3_ Rise of the Machines 2003.csv

","Crap. Dynamite and more dynamite, but no real drama. For those who believe that war is like a western, here are their heroes. But war is not. And in this film there is no single historical reference.Does knowing handle explosives to give more ""drama"" to a movie entitled to replace an effective war story? Why this film is - supposedly- set in Russia during WWII? The filmmakers have simply sought excuses to prove they are capable of using more dynamite that has been used in any other movie.And the drama course is simply stupid, if not entirely child. Admittedly Maximilian Shell makes a very good comic role as the Nazi general in search of his iron cross. But the problem is that the film is not intended to be a comedy.

lewiskendell,8,2,5,21-Aug-10," One of my favorite horror flicks of the 2000s.
","""Well...we got four. Four bullets.""The Mist is probably my favorite Stephen King adaptation. When military experimentation opens a door to another dimension, a small town in the northeast U.S. is swiftly and completely blanketed by a thick fog. A fog inhabited by terrifying creatures that may mean the end of everything. A group of people trapped inside a supermarket must then try to survive dangers both external and internal.Â Since this is based on a King story, you know that there's going to be more to it than just monsters killing humans. Conflict between the people in the store is just as much of a threat as the horrors of the mist, and outsiders versus the town natives and misguided fanaticism brought about by fear are two of the major themes of the plot. It's nice when a horror movie is interesting beyond the usual shocks and gore, and that's one of the strong points of The Mist.I thought the creature designs were good, if not amazing. They looked suitably frightening for the most part, and the actors did a good job of reacting to the beasts, which is always important with CG creatures. Another strong (and very King-esquire) point was the ending, which was absolutely fantastic. I think this would be worth seeing for the ending, alone.The Mist gets a full recommendation from me. It's horrifying (if you have a aversion to spiders like me, you will be permanently scarred), and has that trademark Steven King vibe that elevates it beyond typical horror. It's been a few years since the first time I've seen it, but it still was just as entertaining the second time around.

","i thought that the film on the whole was very good, a few dodgy parts here and there, for example people in Holland speak Dutch not German, but other than that i had no major qualms about the film.It starts off in Holland, where 2 American backpackers (Josh and Pax) and there drifter friend (Oli)are having the time off their lives getting high on Pot and the beautiful ladies, they get locked out of their hostel, and cause upset to the local people, when they are called up to a flat where a lad called Alexei lives, he tells them about a hostel in Bratislava, Slovakia, where there is women by the shed load, willing to do anything with three strapping lads like themselves, and being American well accept for Oli (the king of swing)who is the viking equivalent of Casanova in this film, the women of Slovakia would fall at their feet, this said they up and legged it to Slovakia, well actually they got a train, but that is besides the point. On the train, they come across a man, who takes a shine to our young Josh, and upset Pax, by eating with his FINGERS (cos that is a crime in some quarters of the world).They finally get to Slovakia and it is exactly like Alexei had described (of course). But that's where the strange events unfold, Oli is dancing with a girl from Holland, i think, but in the morning has left with one of the Japanese girls, he is later seen with his head stuck to a chair, and the Japanese girl is getting her toes clipped.Josh and Pax meanwhile are tanked up on booze and Josh becomes so intoxicated he goes for a lie down and wakes up in a torture chamber, Jesus that would be some dream. This is where he discovers our finger eating friend from the train, who along with others is aroused by torture. Pax is the last man standing and he goes to the shop of horrors and almost gets served up with lettuce, when some weirdo comes at him with a chainsaw, but he gets away, finds the other Japanese girl, who was having a date with a blow torch, but when they get to the train station, she sees her reflection in a glass sign post, and jumps in front of a train (like you would, you know!?!), so not even this can stop our gallant hero Pax, he gets on the train, and is just relaxing with a nice Sambucca, when he hears the man, that was on the train, the last time he was, he follows him to a mens room and does the business at hand, giving him a taste of his own medicine.

","I saw The Amazing Spiderman 3 days ago now, I did not want to write on something without really taking time to digest what I saw in the theatre. Is this movie perfect? No it is not. However it is very close.As people keep comparing the Rami series to this new one I will tell you why it is a great movie buy itself then go into why it is better overall than the other three.First, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone played their respective roles perfectly. It is like they somehow pulled the characters right out of the comics and brought them to life. And the chemistry between them right on (the subtle way that love creeps up and your not really sure how to act or what to say) Andrew Shows a true Peter Parker and a true Spiderman with all his banter at the bad-guys and himself. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are a true looking Aunt and uncle that have taken the role of parent (I have a friend living in the same circumstance ) and shown what it is really like. The scene in the house when they fight is very touching and makes uncle Ben's' death more hart breaking. Second, showing how peter figures out his powers was okay I didn't really like the football scene with the post bending (that was a little too much even for me) However the skateboarding to show how he has infinitely better balance and agility was a nice touch.Third, The villain was not great CGI and a bit rushed in making, however the fight scenes where very entertaining. Doc Connors was shown as a man divided my moral and personal choices and I would have liked to have seen more between him and Rajit Ratha. Oh and as my son is reading over my shoulder I have to put in he thought it was really funny through the whole movieOkay now for the comparison. People are complaining about No J.J, To bad J.J is not Spiderman nor was he in the Origin of Spiderman he comes in later on when he needs a job.Gwen Stacy is no Mary Jane. Of course not THEY ARE DIFFERENT Gwen is Peters first true love and Mary Jane comes later after her death. Gwen is Peters Intellectual equal and loves Peter for Peter. Mary-Jane Loves Peter cause he is Spiderman Toby vs Andrew - Andrew hands down, Toby is a brooding teen that nobody notices. This is not Peter Parker. Peter is a genus in is own right who tries to do the right thing based on the positive upbringing he had by his aunt and uncle and Andrew portrays this well.Okay and here is the Main reason why I liked this one better. It was not as campy (yes there is campy and then there is Rami campy) Rami's Spiderman was swimming in campy from the really bad Goblin suit to the overall tone of the film and let us not forget the landlord (that was a wast of time to sit through)This Spiderman brings us back to what Spiderman is about, trying to do the right thing but not always doing it right. And finding your way in a world that is very complicated.

As she wanders round looking for her prince Robert, a divorce lawyer, and his young daughter help her. Edward follows through the fountain to find his beloved.As I watched the opening scenes I was fairly sure I wasn't going to like the film but once the action moved to New York where everything became live action I really enjoyed it and laughed often even though I'm sure I'm not part of the target demographic. Amy Adams was an utter delight as Giselle; making the character a naÃ¯ve innocent without being irritating. James Marsden hammed it up in an entertaining fashion and Timothy Spall was fun as his less than trustworthy sidekick. Also of note was Patrick Dempsey who played Robert; it can't have been easy playing the one normal main character amongst a group of fairytale characters. While this is a fairytale it is rather nice that for once the heroine wasn't just a damsel in distress; when there is danger Giselle is quick to get stuck in.

We start off in Borat's home village which is full of white-trash dressed in clothes they believe are ""cool"" in the West and where anti-Semitism is regarded as a participation sport. Borat travels to the U.S. to make a documentary and takes a road-trip from New York to California in an ice-cream van he buys for $700. Borat uses the pretext of the documentary to meet real people and we observe the reaction as he attempts to shock them. Borat's victims are keen to appear on Kazakhstani television and most Americans he meets have no problem in believing that the citizens of his country are stupid peasants. Borat breaks many of the taboos of polite Western society by making outrageous statements or behaving disgustingly. It's like a revolting re-interpretation of Candid Camera. Cohen's technique is to extract idiotic remarks and the audience is asked to laugh at the brainless dupes. His antics include: defecating in a flower bed in the middle of New York and telling a group feminists that women have smaller brains. One of the strangest scenes involves an extended bout of vigorous nude wrestling with his producer, a fat, ugly hairy man. Cohen literally has his head up the guy's ass.Most of the U.S. movie review I have read see the movie as a hilarious satire about America. The aim of satire is usually to ridicule the follies of humanity or poke fun at the rich and powerful. As a Brit, my view is that Cohen is simply ""taking the p*ss"" out of America's great unwashed. In every country in the world you will find people prepared to say ridiculous things for their 15 minutes of fame. Most teenage boys will enjoy its sadism and find the movie hysterically funny in the same way they enjoy the Jackass movies. I'm not sure what to make of the exaggerated claims for Cohen's brilliance but some of his antics are very funny. I know my wife and mother won't enjoy it.",Borat_ Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan 2006.csv

","Its been 24 hours since I've seen Mary and Max and find I've been deeply affected by the film. Its the story of a little girl who needs to know somethings so she writes a letter to a random person in America only to connect with an sweet man with some decided peculiar ways. What happens after that is a series of ups and downs that happen over the course of 20 years. A unique film its possibly the best animated film from 2009, and its one of the best films of the year. Rarely has a film left me so emotionally moved, certainly there are even fewer that have made me feel this way many hours after the fact. I feel as though I'm carrying the characters and emotions around inside me. And in a way I'm at a loss for words. A beautifully animated film with dialog that is witty and wise and wonderful, this is a marvelously made film. However its the characters where it shines. All of the characters, even if they are somewhat clichÃ©, are painfully real. We know someone like everyone of them. Your heart goes out to them and is carried by them because they are so real. Its the characters we remember and we return to and who carry the film even as the second half gets messy. A masterpiece.",Mary and Max 2009.csv
RElKO,9,1,2,25-Jul-00," One of the best Stephen King adaptations.
","This movie is an adaptation of the first book Stephen King ever wrote, and i think it couldn't have been better.First of all, it's directed by Brian DePalma, who made some dreadfully boring thrillers (Obsession), but also some very suspenseful thrillers (Dressed to kill, Body double). This falls into the second category. It also has some great actors at the start of their careers. After this movie, Sissi Spacek, Piper Laurie, John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving became highly respected actor/actresses.What makes this movie work so well is the involvement with the characters. Carrie, the main characters is a tragic and (aside from the supernatural powers) very realistic character. Who hasn't know a very insecure, shy teenage girl that the more popular people used to pick on. Only this time payback is a bitch. And although the way Carrie executes revenge on all those who have taunted her is very violent, you can't help but sympathize with her after all she's been through. Here was a girl who after a very unhappy childhood was given a glimmer of hope by being chosen as the prom queen, only to find out it was a setup for the most disturbing, embarrassing humiliation possible. Sissi Spacek is especially great at this point, when she's lost all her marbles. Piper Laurie is fantastic as the domineering, religious fanatic mother, and the likes of John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving are pure evil personified as heartless classmates of Carrie who are relentless in their badgering of her.Weakhearted people should brace themselves for the final shot.",Carrie 1976.csv
ClaytonDavis,10,20,46,24-Dec-14," Ava DuVernay's passion pours from the screen with a history making performance from David Oyelowo...
","Passionate, informative, and tenderly told, Ava DuVernay's vision of Martin Luther King Jr. and his fight for voters' rights is fully realized in her newest film ""Selma."" Written by Paul Webb, the film is ambitious, moving, and features a performance fit for the history books from David Oyelowo. It's one of the single best things you can see in 2014.In a time where the state of our country is in disarray over race and politics, ""Selma"" hits our doorsteps at the right time for both sides of the coin to indulge and see how far we've come, or how little we actually have. ""Selma"" shows the good and the bad, the perfect and imperfect characteristics of one of the most important figures in the fight for civil rights. There's respect, which goes without question, but there's an emotional and raw honesty that DuVernay and Webb choose to tell us about the man who was Dr. King. She doesn't paint the rosey picture you'd come to expect from standard biopics these days. She lays it out, leaving us to decide for ourselves if something outside of what he contributed to our country is great enough to look passed. DuVernay offers in many ways, the single best direction of the year.Invigorating from beginning to end, David Oyelowo owns every frame of the picture. You don't see performances like this too often especially of a real-life figure like MLK. I go back to works like Denzel Washington (""Malcolm X""), Ben Kingsley (""Gandhi""), and George C. Scott (""Patton"") to find a more jaw-dropping or complex acting performance. Something like this only seems to come around once a decade. This may be our decade's. It's more than just the embodiment, it's the decisions in the silence that makes Oyelowo so amazing. You will remember this performance forever.The entire cast does an admirable to amazing job in their respective roles. Carmen Ejogo is simply electrifying as Coretta Scott King. An impeccable example of wearing the emotions and feelings at the brim without letting go. Just sensational top to bottom.Despite some hiccups in the accent department, Tom Wilkinson and Tim Roth are serviced well as Lyndon B. Johnson and George Wallace. Both have their opportunities to stand out in their respective scenes but ultimately stand as reminders that we are eagerly waiting to get back to Dr. King.DuVernay's triumph comes from the extras and smaller name cast she utilizes as sprinkles in every instance that they appear. Stan Houston as the treacherous Sheriff Clark is superbly focused and embodies the mindset of every unfortunate person of hate during the time. Henry G. Sanders and Keith Stanfield in many ways become the heart and soul of the film without no more than just a few moments of screen time. Oprah Winfrey and Lorraine Toussaint also execute their roles proficiently.The slick and vivacious manner in which ""Selma"" is assembled is thanks to the genius people behind the camera. Cinematographer Bradford Young is just too great at what he does at this point in his career. With another stunning framing form in J.C. Chandor's ""A Most Violent Year,"" he rises in the ranks to join Roger Deakins and Emmanuel Lubezki as one of the most exciting DP's. Spencer Averick's editing keeps ""Selma"" on pace, and engaging 100% of the time. Jason Moran's score is palpable and justified in every sense of its usage.""Selma"" is just a joy to behold, a magnificent example of passionate filmmaking that lacked sorely in 2014. It propels DuVernay among the ranks of the best filmmakers working today. Naturally brought to tears, it's a gut-wrenching and honest look into our history. Fulfilling, promised, and profound. One of the year's best films.",Selma 2014.csv

He was not the official ruler of the country since 1911, however, the mind of hundreds millions of the people living under the monarchy system for thousands years still believe in so called ""emperor. Satirically, on the contrary, all his life was just a tool, used by the republic, by the invaders, finally deserted and left rotten in a cell. Trough his struggling we see the country's misery. As he crowned as a child knowing nothing about governing, the country is on the brink of overturn. As he sat titularly in the forbidden city, the country is wavering in the grasps of warlords. As he became a playboy, the so called ""republic government"" is nothing more that a puppet of world powers. When he thoughts he could eventually make a change, what he did is nothing but betrayed his country. Finally he walked out of the prison. What he saw was total craziness. 
However the movie does not judge whether he is right or wrong. It contains no embellishment of a hero. That makes it an epic, not a story.",The Last Emperor 1987.csv

wildhart,8,2,4,09-Feb-08," Beatles are the soundtrack of the times
","I have waited for this film to be released on DVD, it seems like forever and played it as soon as Netflix came through. Although I felt that the film started a very bit slow, it did pick up nicely. My friend Roger is much better at analysis and criticism of films than I, so this is more of a consumer reaction than a real review.When I saw clips for this, I kept thinking of Moulin Rouge, but I could never really get my head around Moulin Rouge. The use of Beatles songs is a soundtrack for the times, which is where Moulin Rouge broke down for me: the juxtaposition of the era and the modern songs came off as too arbitrary for my taste.The musical arrangements and performances for Across the Universe were stellar and beautiful. For me, one of the true highlights of the film came when the plaintive and pure voice of Timothy Mitchum began singing Let It Be in that very moving sequence, with Carol Wood. It was somber, breathtaking and heartbreaking.Seeing Joe Cocker pop up was a delight, though I'd have been even happier had he sung With a Little Help From My Friends. The musicality of the I Want You/She's So Heavy number, and the symbolism involved, was wonderful, and captured the zeitgeist of the counterculture viewpoint of US involvement in Vietnam.I didn't mind Bono, though I've read some criticism of him in this (yes he was well disguised). His semi-Dennis-Hopper-Easy-Rider-meets-Doctor-Hook character was appropriate for its purpose. What I wasn't in love with was the Eddie Izzard-Mr. Kite sequence. It was a bit too dark for me, and the Monty Python-ness of it seemed a bit out of time synch for me, though I confess I can't recall whether Python was well known in the US prior to the 1970s, but if the time line of the film was in the least bit adhered to, this film was set in 1967-1968 (Martin Luther King was killed in the film), the summer of love giving way to more violent war protest and confrontations. I suppose that's being too picky. I really liked the rooftop concert nod and I wonder why Dana Fuchs wasn't being considered to play Janis Joplin.All notes aside, I was loving this film, it was an honest look at the era, with all its warts, and how a generation could move from hopefulness and idealism to cynicism and disillusionment. I'm fairly certain when I can, I'll buy it for my collection.",Across the Universe 2007.csv

Tom Cruise was as always impressive. Tim Robbins is wasted in the movie.The Screenplay is ok but with few stupid scenes i really doubt the wisdom of the screenplay writer as i failed to understand the reason behind some of the scenes. For instance In one of the scenes Robbie played by Justin Chatwin just starts running in the direction of Aliens in order to fight with them and that too empty handed means i can't understand the reason behind the bravado as the army were not able to fight with the Aliens with ammunitions and he wanted to fight with them empty handed. In another scene when the alien tripod sees the Ferrier father and daughter sleeping Rachel started shouting and flees but why? If you think form the perspective of a kid they will never leave their parent in such scenarios and will try to be as close as possible.

harrymadsen,1,11,28,26-Nov-03," Over the top and superficial
","A major disappointment.How many times must we see bloody battle scenes shot in mind numbing slow motion to the strains of overpowering string music?  Apparently, the filmmakers who brought us The Last Samurai think we need to see it many more times.  My guess is that Ed Zwick and his team meant to portray the horror of war, but guess what, we got it after the first thirty minutes. Showing the same thing over and over again, especially when the result is pre-ordained does not make for good film making.And it's not like the script offers much of anything in the way of characters.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but don't expect any insight into any of the characters, they are strictly superficial, have no life of their own besides trading platitudes with each other and you keep waiting for them to develop but they don't.  And this coming from the screenwriters who wrote Thirtysomething and Once And Again.  It makes you wonder if there's any place for good screenwriting in today's studio films.Another major problem is the complete inconsistency in the main character's fighting ability.  After slaying countless Samurai warriors, he finds himself unable to resist for more than three seconds when, taken prisoner he trains with them.  And given that this training takes a good half hour of screen time, that is no minor peeve.Another major screenwriting snafu is that apparently, Ed Zwick and his crew were too busy filming everything in slow motion that they didn't notice that at no point is the reason for all this fighting explained.  Maybe they have a degree in Japanese history, for they clearly are quite bright and display a real interest in Japanese culture that bring about one of the the sole qualities of the film, but the rest of the audience doesn't.  I know about the Meiji era being the time of cultural upheaval when Japan modernized itself by importing Western ideas and knowledge, but that's about it.  I was looking forward to learning more but after the first ten minutes of the film, the bloody gore takes over and any insight into Japanese history is forgotten.Add to that a picture quality that was much less than satisfactory (was the whole film treated with a low resolution digital intermediate, because it lacked any sharpness or detail in the blacks in 90% of the shots) and you have a film that can be summed up as a complete waste of time.Avoid at all costs unless you're a major Tom Cruise fan (and he does a great job with what little the script gave him) and you need to see every frame of every project he's in.",The Last Samurai 2003.csv

As an entertainment device, it holds up for an hour or so - but it could not possibly survive multiple viewings. Quite an inversion from the norm.Most science fiction is a crucible for social politics, and this alternate Star Trek fares well here. Beyond the great visuals and jaunty dialogue, selected characters have a vague inner life and back story. The original Trek cannon is adhered to on occasion, and this provides some backbone though by the end of the film even Salman Rushdie would be seeking less magic realism.Due to the pure entertainment value the film delivers, this will probably spawn a franchise - but only if the plot is not taken from scrawlings on the lavatory at Walmart.",Star Trek 2009.csv

","PLOT-CRUNCH:
Mutants are a reality. The ""normal"" population fear them and want them gone. Many mutants live in fear until Professor X (Stewart) a mutant himself, opens up a school where all mutants can find refuge and also learn how to control their powers. A specific group of mutants, led by Magneto (McKellen) have a nasty plan reserved for the masses and it's up to Professor X and his team of brave students to stop them. It's a freak war that will blow your mind.
THE LOWDOWN:
I cannot compare this film to the comics it's based on cause I never followed them. But on its own, I must say this is a very good movie, a solid platform to build a franchise on. First off, the casting is dead on and I predict a new star in the guise of Hugh Jackman (Wolverine). The man looks like a young ""Clint Eastwood"" has rough charm to boot and knows how to move when it comes to fight scenes. Wolverine is by far the more interesting character in the film and trust me, you will love him. I appreciated that the movie took its time to set up its situation and main characters. It makes the last 20 minutes of slam, bang, mutant action way more rewarding. The visual effects are top notch and the combat scenes rival the ones we saw in ""The Matrix"". Prepare to be dazzled.My few complaints are A) The movie has many characters but spends most of its time developing Wolverine and Rogue. In the process it leaves other ""main"" characters in the dust. Storm (Berry), Cyclops (Marsden) and the villains were way underdeveloped. I guess we'll find more about them in the sequels.B) Ian McKellen is a wonderful actor and when Magneto was out of costume, he worked. But for the life of me I laughed my butt off when I saw him in his get up, metal helmet and all. I would compare the feeling to going to a rave and seeing a 60 year old dude, flashing glow sticks and sucking on a lollipop. He just looks silly. Maybe a younger actor would have been a better casting choice.But enough nit picking, this film delivers on most fronts, has a likeable cast, wonderful visual effects, a good story, breathtaking fight scenes, some humor (the bantering between Cyclops and Wolverine is hilarious), great heroes and amusing villains (I especially enjoyed the morphing, ass kicking Mystique). Enter the world of The X-Men.
ACTING:Patrick Stewart is Professor X, he doesn't have much to do but he's the perfect chive for the part. Hugh Jackman has a cool name and gives life to one of the most interesting anti-heroes of the year. Wolverine walks the walk and talks the talk, I couldn't get enough of him. Anna Paquin (Rogue) also does very well, her vulnerable show will surely touch you and her scenes with ""Jackman"" are amazing. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) has maybe one line but she's by far one of the coolest villains in the flick. She has a bod to kill for and knows how to whoop that ass. Ray Park (Toad) also does good in a mostly physical part. He brings some humor to the film and even gives us one of his ""Darth Maul"" moves.Tyler Mane (Sabertooth) let's the makeup do most of the acting cause he doesn't have much to do but look menacing. He didn't do anything for me either way but he does have a great fight scene with ""Jackman"". Ian McKellen (Magneto) gives another solid performance, he brings depth to the character and we understand where he's coming fromÂ…too bad he looks funny in that funky helmet. Famke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey) and James Marsden (Cyclops) don't have much screen time but bring lots of presence when they're on. Janssen is sexy and Marsden is witty. Can't wait to see more of them in the sequel. Halle Berry (Storm) looks amazing in costume but is very underused. Also what is up with that accentÂ…it comes and goes like the flu.
GORE:No gore but some kool cartoon violence and amazing effects. I loved the ""Mystique"" design, the Toad tongue and the Wolverine claws.DIRECTING:Singer is very effective giving the film a comic book feel but somehow managing to also keep it grounded in reality. It makes the fantastic scenes more powerful (an example would be the police showdown with Magneto). He moves the film at a fast pace, gives us some kool shots and well directed fight sequences. Good show.
SOUNDTRACK:The score is very under whelming. A bit more juice in the music would have been appreciated.
BOTTOM LINE:X-Men fans rejoice, the film gives the comic book justice. Movie fans rejoice, we got ourselves a good summer movie that will surely thrill you. The movie looks slick, has a sympathetic cast, good writing, good production values and a kickarse ending. And for all you ""Marvel"" fans out there let's see if you spot the reference to the ""comic book"" Wolverine and another Marvel hero that goes by the name of ""Iceman"". I for one am looking forward to the sequel already. I can't wait to witness more of the X-Men world. Have a blast!
BULL'S EYE:The film was shot in Toronto, Canada. Hugh Jackman is Australian and will surely follow in Russell Crowe's footsteps.",X-Men 2000.csv

","I will be forthright, I was very aporetic towards the potency of this film when the concept was paraphrased to me. I simply couldn't previse any latent substance in apperceptive video game characters with fatalistic masquerades. However, the opening scene was quite the epiphany from my perspective. The film manages to effectively demonstrate its amenities and capture the interest of the spectator and adamantly refuses to relinquish it throughout the entire film.After observing the copious appearances of commonplace gaming entities such as, for instance, Pac-man; I had presumed that the film merely referenced them in order to execute a more demographic approach to captivating public interest in the film, however, this inclination was also erroneous. The film provides an evident obeisance to several more obscure characters as well, which I myself found convivial.The conflict of the film is also very poignant. The plot components are very subtle and gradually evince the juxtaposition between each occurrence to the viewer at applicable times.Overall, I would highly recommend viewing this film.

","This movie is good if: - you lived through this episode of American history - you read about the movie online - you like ChessThis movie is not good if: - you're inviting people for a night outIt was neat and the acting was great -- me and my friends aren't big on chess so the only way we knew what was happening was through their facial expressions. Unfortunately, this movie is so both fastpaced and slow that it manages to skip through any suspense or depth and yet really drags on at parts. For people who just want to enjoy a movie, Pawn Sacrifice is more confusing than Harry Potter 4. You don't get to explore the historical context within the movie nor does it really dive into Fischer's psychosis.The movie really moved me however as I understood the depressing mood of the US at the time and the tension that any contact with the Russians could result in nuclear war. But for anyone who doesn't know these things, it looks like a magical world where people are holding their breath waiting for two people to make their moves on a chess board. This isn't eisenhower and Lenin playing, nor is it Obama and Putin. Although it does mention the idea of ideological struggle between capitalism and communism, it doesn't persist long enough for uninformed viewers to understand the importance of proxy matches between east and west. If you're young or fell asleep during history class (especially for those in an international audience from nations not really impacted by the cold war ... aka 98% of countries) you're continuously confused about why the focus on chess, as artful a game as it is.Anyway, it was a good movie and decently directed for what they were given (110 mins running time I believe) and my angst is really against reviewers on IMDb that insist the film makes chess seem exciting. No it doesn't and for those who aren't waiting for this poor young man from Brooklyn to grow up to be a sensational hero for the US, his personal foibles and struggles don't really resonate.In fact I guess I can somewhat agree with the guy that was rooting for the Russians.

pyrocitor,7,3,5,15-Sep-16," True to form, Blade doesn't suck
","He kicks enough slow-mo ass in a long black coat to make Neo go ""Whoa."" He rocks a vampire franchise slick and edgy enough to make RPatz whimper. And he brings enough spurting blood to the superhero blockbuster to make Kevin Feige faint. He's Blade - breakout star of the era when the term 'superhero film' was largely tantamount to 'campy garbage'. And he's a welcome shot of adrenaline to the current day multiplexes bursting at the seams with his more bloodless (ha) brethren. Respect.Director Stephen Norrington knows exactly how to stay on the fun side of campy, and goes right for the jugular in doing so, offering a slick, taut, and hugely entertaining bloodbath. Eschewing both a redundant origin story and some of the decade's more frantic action editing, Blade is marvellously paced, ticking along, shark-like, from exposition to action interlude and back with the hypnotic steadiness of blood pulsing through veins. It's hardly an ambitious plot (stop the pending vampocalypse, natch), but lent welcome life from Norrington and writer David S. Goyer's more inventively gruesome touches. Check out the sprinklers at the underground vampire nightclub dousing the raving crowd in blood in a gleefully macabre Carrie homage, amidst the film's inspired opening sequence, and it's impossible to deny you're in for a garishly amusing treat. Granted, some of the film's stylistic choices (Mark Isham's industrial-influenced soundtrack) age better than others (DP Theo van de Sande shooting the film like a streaky, jump-cutting '90s hip hop video is fairly jarring). But Norrington's flair for the grotesque helps punch up the monster horror fun. His prosthetic deformities and bubbling corpses playfully pilfer the best of Total Recall and Raiders of the Lost Ark, just as the classist in-fighting in the vampire ranks (born vampires sneering condescension at 'turned' bloodsuckers) lends odd nuance to the villainous MacGuffin, while a sterling climactic setpiece amidst a (practical set!) marble vampire temple is as sleekly Gothic as you could ask for. Blade may not reinvent the action wheel, but it certainly gives it a good, vigorous spin in the right direction. As the titular vampire hunter (no, not Abraham Lincoln), Wesley Snipes firmly establishes himself as one of the more reliable '90s badasses. His icy charisma is easily enough to carry the film, even if his attempts at infusing Blade's monolithic masculinity with humour through bursts of twitchy sassiness may take some adjusting to. Still, anyone who can sell a punchline as corny as ""Some motherf*ckers are always trying to ice-skate uphill"" with dignity intact is worth of accolades in my books. Supporting Snipes, N'Bushe Wright astutely refuses any damsel in distress clichÃ©s with a welcome, hardened charisma, at the cost of occasionally neglected to react appropriately to some of the film's more fearsome scenarios. Similarly, as the film's central antagonist, Stephen Dorff is perfectly oily, but his refusal to chew scenery in favour of a more subtle creepiness backfires somewhat, making him a suitable, but fairly forgettable foe. Finally, Kris Kristofferson lends his 'gruff mentor' archetype an appealingly indignant crustiness, bagging many of the film's better lines in the process. As the bodies hit the floor amidst the flurries of impressively executed, cathartically bloody action choreography, a realization sinks in: Blade, for all its leather-clad macho posturing, is a remarkably unpretentious film. It's fun, no- nonsense, and down and dirty, in the ways that only a moderately-budgeted franchise film with low expectations but high potential can be. You can practically see the seeds for 2016's Deadpool's rampant success being lain, albeit with only the tiniest winks of its fourth-wall-toppling zaniness. Still, nearly 20 years on, Blade remains an adeptly unapologetic slice of entertainment.

","I have been following Terminator 3's progress since day one. And the day came when I finaly saw it. With out a doubt a masterpiece. But it took more then one viewing to see Mostow's vision.Too much these days people need them to explain a story by words, and dialouge, like your mother telling you a bedtime story. T3 is one of those deeper movies that once you look past the action there are some deep thoughts, and morality issues it talks about. I love where they took the story, and the character's especially John.Thoguh I am mad to know as a huge fan I followed T3 from day one, watched every interview/set report ect. There was about 40 mintues cut from the movie. Including:-10 Minute Future War Sequence.-An Alternate Opening Credits with the T3 song from soundtrack.
-From some people/the book there was a little more of the stripper joint, and the T-850 did more dammage to the bouncer.-A few more scenes like more of the T-850 grabbing his shotgun after running over the T-X.-The T-X killing Liz Anderson a 10 year old girl.-T-X and more of her and the cop like her saying the exact speed she was going.-The T-X going to Bill Anderson's house, and breaking in.-More of the champion crane sequence you can tell easily by the editing.
-Way more talk in the Tundra with John and the T-850 talking about Judgment Day and the upgrades the T-850 has.-A little more of the store scene, the T-850 grabs the glasses.
-More of John talking in the back of the Tundra with Kate.
-Flashbacks of young John and Kate, we could tell from IMDB's young John in the credits early on.-From old set reports and eye witnesses I think the T-850 disabled or maybe even killed cops originaly in the graveyard shoot out because they talked about how he did kill people in that scene long ago.-More of the Graveyard chase, the T-X right behind them and John is shooting at her.-Way more of a slow scene what it was we may never know from the book either the author of the book said he had to change the versions so many times. That is why it was delayed from June to late July because WB changed it so much. But I think there was much more of a slow desert T2 kind of scene between John and Kate and the Terminator. Just more talking.
-So so so much more of the CRS Labs. Showing how the Terminator's survived and Skynet. And all of the early prototypes being made including the 101 from the real human Arnold Sgt. Candy.-Shows how the T-X gets to the CRS labs with the chopper and gets in.
-How Kate/John/T-850 get into CRS, she calls him Uncle Tom. The T-850 shoots some guards in the knee caps.-More of the T-850 talking to General Brewster about the line he said 'I was made here.'-Extened Bathroom sequence where they accually go through the floor.
-You can tell by editing and the book that originaly they had Kate/John fight a T-1 as well, or at least run from it. But they cut it out.
-Shows from pictures that we see the T-X get out of the particle accelerator and she sees the disabled T-850 standing there and she jumps in the chopper. As she saw John/Kate take off.-Now this scene I gathered from set reports and old talks. I think originaly the T-850 came on line and walked across the air strip with the T-1's shooiting everyone and he is in the midst of it all walking to the big chopper. -Way more of the accual 'Rise of the machines' more of the T-1's killing everyone.-Alternate End fight. From set reports and interviews with Stan/Arnold and Larisis or what ever said the same thing I heard. That there was originaly a huge tunnel chase where the T-X in full endo form ran after the T-850/John and Kate. And it was more of a epic battle between the two. Very expensive but cut sadly enough.These were things we either got from set reports ect.There was an alternate end fight, it will be in the DVD/Game it self.
Though it stinks that these cuts were made the movie was still worthy of the franchise. James Cameron thought so, he loved the movie. And we all know James does not just say things to be nice.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines 9.6/10Highs: Great story, depth, and some serious issues talked about. Great acting and dialouge and ending.Lows: Too much cut, not enough of everything. Lots of the detailed story scenes were cut.Bottom Line: A great film on every level. Not as good as Terminator 2 but I doubt any movie will ever accomplish that. That is a hard feat.

This film was more a study of the descent into madness/psychosis that was colored with horror. It wasn't a horror genre film like Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc. But because it's a story about madness some of the scenes are difficult to understand and to determine if they're ""real"" or part of the character's madness. I'm a dude and not easily scared or intimidated so this film rather than scaring me was just more unsettling and disturbing, it left me in a bad mood, especially with the very odd, weird, again unsettling final scene.

JTurner82,10,7,15,16-May-14," Exceeds frozen expectations.
","I have to admit I almost feel a little embarrassed giving FROZEN my highest rating. However, in spite of my reservations about this retelling -- er, Disneyfication -- of Hans Christian Andersen's SNOW QUEEN -- being a CG film and not a traditional one (the latter format could have been used just as effectively for a film like this) -- FROZEN is surprisingly really good. Which is not something I was expecting to say given how disappointed I was with TANGLED. However, FROZEN earns my highest rating for the following reasons.While this is a ""Disneyfied"" SNOW QUEEN, it's not done in the manner one would normally expect. This is arguably a darker, edgier re-imagining; the title queen in this story is Elsa, one of two sisters whose primary motivation for causing eternal winter is not out of outright evil, but for more complex issues. The whole conflict starts off because of an accident that traumatized her and her sister, Anna, in childhood, leading the girl to become emotionally distant. This lends a surprisingly more ""adult"" angle to the story.But the best part about FROZEN is how Disney turns two of its tried and true clichÃ©s completely on its heels. There IS a handsome prince, yes, and he does romance Anna, but not for the reasons one would expect. Furthermore, the climactic ""act of true love"" needed to break Elsa's spell isn't romantic, but sister related. It's because of this that FROZEN emerges as one of Disney's best fairy tales in a long time.The chemistry between the principal characters is also very well done, especially the sister dynamic between the more aloof, distant Elsa and the outgoing, socially awkward (but sweet- natured) Anna. Prince Hans, as mentioned, isn't the picture perfect figure you'd expect. If anything, the most interesting character has to be Kristoff, a somewhat grumpy ice hauler who grudgingly agrees to help Anna find her, but naturally he turns out to be a real soft- hearted gentleman. Naturally, this DOES give this film a ""love triangle"" angle, but to reveal how it is resolved would be the equivalent of giving spoilers.The music is also great, especially Elsa's charged ballad ""Let it Go."" (The only exception is a gospel-flavored song involving trolls, which isn't BAD by any means, it just struck me as out of place with the tone of the story.) Even the occasional comic relief (from a snowman and a mute elk) doesn't overpower the dramatic depth of the story. There ARE a few places where I think Disney could have toned down the laughs, though, but it's nowhere nearly as grating as in TANGLED.I'm not quite sure where FROZEN ranks in terms of Disney's all-time greatest films, but I WAS pleasantly charmed by it and it exceeded my expectations.",Frozen 2013.csv

Mind you, neither are at their best here as though they had dissonance for being used in a blatant fashion.Just as Quentin Tarantino said that he made BASTERDS because the Holocaust genre was very much in demand by Hollywood producers and financiers, Martin Scorsese just wasn't going to be left out by the manna train and surest ticket to Oscars. So comes Shutter Island that deals with the gory concentration camp lore but more importantly, expands on the treatments of patients/detainees experienced in both; the first (Shutter) is where a very humane experience is conducted in order to break through a deep case of altered and second personality (DiCaprio); the second was used as labor camps for a war machine or in Hollywood and Holocaust meme, as extermination camps.Shutter is another Hollyweird attempt to indoctrinate and disinform the general public. Operation Paperclip and Projects MK-Ultra and Monarch anyone? Paperclip oversaw the whitewash of war criminal records of between 3000 and 5000 German scientists (Von Sydow character who enjoys Mahler to make him more engaging) in a clandestine operation to bring them to the US as war loots. There were rocket scientists - Wernher Von Braun - but also and maybe even more so doctors who used humans as guinea pigs, Mengele ways. Paperclip was folded into Dulles CIA in the fifties.Operation Monarch: covert human mind control project that was instituted in the fifties and early sixties. The roots go back directly to Nazi Germany and Josef Mengele. The goal is to reach and subdue the innermost soul - roughly in age 6 and a half and eight years of age, in every human being, there is a time where the neurones of the brain are not quite fully formed and it was found that if extreme trauma was induced, even to the point of death and torture on a young child, then you can cause these neurones to basically dissociate. They become such that other personalities and even spiritual entities can be implemented in that individual.It's a perfect cover because the core personality, the true individual is in charge but they have multiple individual (altered personalities) hiding behind the curtain so to speak. A monarch goes from one personality to another that can be triggered externally by an handler without being conscious of it. Sirhan Sirhan, RFK killer was most probably a monarch child.Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) is throughout the movie in an altered state as a way to escape a horrendous past that was not of his own doing if one excepts the disfigurement to his supposed ex-partner. All the things alluded in Shutter, rod through an eye, brain butchering are used to demonize inhuman treatments but there are just parts of a whole range of treatments used the world over in mind control. The innocuous role playing which is the base of the whole film only serves to hide what really goes on on Shutter Island or in the US/West as a rule, hence disingenuous.To accept that only humane treatment goes on is to be a willing denier and co-participant in mass programming. In so doing, we're left with a very simple black and white dichotomy that tricks us into accepting the bad cards we are dealt with in a game of playing with our own brain. The very last sentence Dicaprio says is revealing, something like: Is it better to live as a bad guy or to die as a good guy? And off he goes to the butcher table in a pseudo heroic stance so as ""to kill"" his guilt feelings; be dumb and guilt free, that's Hollywood message. Sorry but I refuse to be lobotomized. Better to live with your eyes wide open and see for what Shutter Island is no matter how bad.",Shutter Island 2010.csv

Sergeant_Tibbs,7,1,4,23-Jan-14," Wickedly satisfying.
","The pairing of Leonardo DiCaprio with Martin Scorsese is starting to make Marty's collaborations with Robert De Niro feel like a distant memory. As if Scorsese was a different filmmaker then and now an imitation of himself. But nobody stays on top forever and this is an apt contemporary substitute for the films on the highlight reel of Scorsese's career. That said, The Departed, DiCaprio's third and most successful collaboration certainly belongs among Scorsese's essential canon, it seems The Wolf Of Wall Street is quickly gaining a reputation of apparently deserving a spot too. The cashier at the cinema even said that the film makes his top ten, not of the year, but all-time. It ostensibly has a dedicated fan-base already. But that tends to be the appeal of such dark material in an energetic, pull-no-punches but gloss-it-up style. Written by Terence Winter, Wolf unfortunately doesn't have the sophisticated grace and tension of his television show Boardwalk Empire, but instead it's a bewitching manic tale of excess through an excessive perspective. It's self-indulgent. But this self is infamous maverick Jordan Belfort and his, note this, white ferrari. It's like Mad Men plus Looney Toons. It's wild as can be.All of man's temptations are here, money, sex, drugs and most importantly power. Even though the film is about something as dry as the stock market, it's all about the non-stop masculine energy and almost every office scene predominantly features boisterous extras jostling each other rather than working. But despite its graphic depiction of the sex and drugs, there's a distinct Hollywood sheen on it all that makes it hard to take seriously. Every shot in the film is lit and framed like a tabloid magazine cover. But this is all deliberate and merely the point. This is the type of shallow and impossible life these men lead and rather than inviting us to their celebration, it reflects their pathetic behaviour. Scenes run deliberately too long to push past the silly shock and consider the humanity. It's a very interesting way to approach the film, especially one usually edited so sharply, but it's sinfully un-cinematic for a Scorsese film. While we're presented with entertaining sequences of depraved characters indulging their vices, through all the glamour, it leaves you alone into how to interpret its moral code. At the very least, it's not preachy, and perhaps the film's acclaim is its own social commentary. It's something only Scorsese could get away with, really. Ironically, the film is at its most captivating during motivational speeches by its blisteringly shining star Leonardo DiCaprio. During these scenes, he's never been more on fire in his whole career. It's the closest he's come to having his charisma be infectious, which is something, although he's a reliably great actor, that he's never quite had like his peers Johnny Deep, Brad Pitt and more. Overcoming the clearly inexperienced and weaker supporting cast that usually inhabit Scorsese films are a delightful and lively set of cameos from Matthew McConaughey, Rob Reiner, Spike Jonze, Jean Dujardin and Kyle Chandler, who really help the film combat its length. Margot Robbie is great casting as his wife with a performance thoroughly sincere, but the now bizarrely Oscar nominated Jonah Hill is a different case in that regard. He's definitely undergone a convincing transformation but it's difficult to tell when his character is serious, pretending for a joke or pretending to look serious. But perhaps that's the ambiguous yet frustrating point of his character. He brings an essential obnoxious quality to the film, which is a contribution to both its lurid yet endearing charm and unfortunately also the terribly irritating aspects of the film that don't work.Hill and the male supporting cast are at their most useful when they bring the best in Leonardo DiCaprio, who truly earned his Golden Globe for Comedy with some spot on delivery and comedic physicality without feeling inconsistent. Although the film may drag in certain scenes as they ramble to get to their point, it leaves you wanting more, especially with its thought- provoking final moments. Even so, it's difficult to shake off the film without feeling guilty for the suffering of Jordan Belfort's victims. Maybe this is an essential global pity that they need to require retribution, or maybe Scorsese should've mentioned them in the film more to balance it out. It does feel like he's just trying to relive Goodfellas. There's no denying that it shares similar attributes with its kinetic camera-work, snarky voice-over, rocking soundtrack, monumental runtime, smoking money and kicking down of the fourth wall. But what could've been an exhilarating and devastating ride is just an engaging, intriguing and occasionally ghastly one. Perhaps he's compensating for the misfired Hugo. If so, fine, you're forgiven. The Wolf Of Wall Street is wickedly satisfying for now. Now give us something with weight. Bring us Silence already.7/10",The Wolf of Wall Street 2013.csv

","District 9, a Science Fiction with a message the movie depicts the social impact of prejudice on a people or in this case an Alien Society. The set in Johannesburg, South Africa them is a generalization, of the treatment of blacks in South Africa. The way the movie starts off with the running of the Aliens and the Army chasing them is somewhat documenting, Apartheid. The movies moves on into great action and very good acting by the main characters Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley) who is the bureaucrat, that became infected by a virus created by the Aliens to power their ship home. The movie is somewhat a docudrama in that it's telling the story suffering in the shanty town, yet it is full of action and entertaining. My first thought upon seeing the movie, was here we go again an alien movie about them visiting or living Earth and Earth is no very friendly to them. After viewing the movie for a while I began to see that it was much more than that. The movie really carries a strong message about prejudices in our society and to what length some will go to the keep that prejudices alive and well. The movie's plot was well formed in that it leads you into the story and brings the themes of the movie to the forefront of the movie. You really don't have to guess at the plot, once van de Merwe becomes infected you know that he will see what it like to live in the shoes of another and the prejudices that goes alone with it. The movie was very entertaining and well directed by Neill Blomkamp, and the screenplay by Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell was well written. The movie leaves a lasting impression on you and even now I can see the helicopter and the landing. The movie was so full of action that you didn't want it to end and you were pulling for van de Merwe to get on the ship and make it out of the camp. In rating the movie I would give it about 3 stars, only because I thought some of the scenes were a little over done, like the interview scenes, they could have been shorter.

","Let me start by saying that I am a massive Evil Dead fan, and believe that Evil Dead II is one of the greatest sequels ever. With that said, I went in to the Evil Dead Remake, boomstick in hand ready to shoot myself when I sensed a bad movie.Evil Dead 2013 continues Hollywood's sluggish attempt to bring back every horror movie you ever loved and squash it, taking as much joy and charm away from its original film that it actually pains you. Surely, they would have learned from My Bloody Valentine 3D, right? Wrong.The story here is pretty much the same, and actually probably more coherent to begin with than ED 1 & 2 - as five teens go to a Cabin In The Woods to support their drug addicted member through the next few days as she tries to go cold turkey. Unfortunately for her and the rest of Scooby Doo-esque gang of friends, an evil book is discovered... The main problem with this film is its lack of charisma. All of the fresh faced leads are useless and stereotypical to the genre. Gone is the amazing/terrible acting display of the brilliant/awful Bruce Campbell, replaced instead with ""Shiloh Fernandez"". I'm fine with bad acting (look back at any of your favourite horror films - they will all have someone with the facial expressions of a tree, or ""Lacktors"" if you will), but apart from looking pretty, Fernandez has literally nothing otherwise that stops you from wanting to see him killed by something horrible in these evil woods. Gone too is literally any kind of humour. hile ED2 had this bizarre twisted funny bone running through it, this movie doesn't even attempt it. No lines, no puppets, no deer head, nothing. This isn't a bad thing, because I'd argue that Army of Darkness (the third in the Evil Dead series) went a little too over the top. But not even a line? A sly reference to the original? Nope. Nothing. Going back to other bad horror remakes, I can remember that even Friday the 13th 2009 had a few stabs (!) at it. On saying that, I did laugh twice at unintentionally hysterical parts, both involving Jane Levy. Our addicted heroine of sorts, while becoming possessed, she witnesses lots of strange things, and just look out for her reflection... it's stupidly hilarious. Which leads me on to the deaths. This film was given an 18 certificate in the UK, something so rare these days, which'll be a result of this being actually a mash up of both ED part 1 and 2, pilfering the best bits from both of them. With that comes lots of the makeshift weapons used in both, tweaked ever so slightly. Like the originals, this movie's best moments come from the practical effects: lots of blood, tongues, hands, etc, with one scene involving a razor blade standing out, and giving you your only scene where you stop and go ""Wow, that's not terrible and looks actually quite good"". Unfortunately, that is the only highlight. Otherwise, each death is really rather flat, dull even.If you want to do a remake involve George Romero (Dawn of the Dead 2004 and The Crazies 2010 were both inferior but great), otherwise please please stay away, as films like this are straight up painful to sit through.In the Evil Dead movies the characters are possessed by evil spirits and turned in to monsters. It's just a shame Evil Dead 2013 has been taken over by something so unscary, lifeless and frankly boring that it makes you want to cut off your own hand and chase yourself out of the cinema with it. @JonnyJonJon1",Evil Dead 2013.csv

A movie with so much going for it--a good cast, a great setting, and an interest basic story--shouldn't be as simple-mindedly written as Good Will Hunting is.  Hardly Oscar-worthy, the script plays more like a final assignment from a first year screenwriting class.  Almost completely lacking in invention and subtlety, the script seems aimed toward the lowest common denominator of the age group that wrote it--in this case, early to mid-twenties.

","One of Oliver Stone's best films. For me, Oliver Stone's quality of work throughout his career varies immensely, but then how many have achieved his eclecticism, and control. After reading the complaints people have had with this film, it really seems as if the film is overshadowed by expectations and, of course, stomach-aches over homosexuality. The film isn't about Alexander's battles (the theatrical release, I'm talking about here, not the faux ""Director's Cut""), it's about him; his life. An idea of what a real human being might be like if we are to interpret historical accounts of him with reason rather than wonder. It's not supposed to be Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, or Ridley Scott's Gladiator. It's not about Greece, or patriotism, or duty, or honor. It's not a myth. Instead it's a more realistic perspective of a man set against the myth.

moviexclusive,9,2,2,05-Jan-11," Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale give two of the best performances you'll see this year- and thanks to them, this boxing drama is deeply poignant and stirring
","""Irish"" Micky Ward was the born-and-bred boxer from the working-class Massachusetts city of Lowell who fought his way to an unlikely world championship in the year 2000. Mark Wahlberg's passion project ""The Fighter"" traces the rise of Micky from no more than a ""stepping stone"" (i.e. someone you fight with just to rise up the ranks) to his sweet victory as junior welterweight world champion. As far as boxing dramas go, this tale of an underdog who battles the odds to accomplish a shot at the big time may seem familiar, but David O'Russell's film proves that there is still plenty of punch in the genre. Russell is acutely aware that the best boxing dramas don't keep their combats confined in the ring; rather, that ringside victory is but only a metaphor of the boxer's triumph over adversity in his/her own life, and the genuine payoff for an audience emotionally vested in the character's personal struggles. So in addition to being a rousing boxing drama, this is also a psychologically complex family drama, a sweet and poignant love story, and most of all, a complicated tale of two brothers. Russell's greatest accomplishment? Weaving together all these disparate elements together into a knockout of a film. When we first meet Micky, he has just lost three fights in a row, and though his older half-brother and trainer Dicky Ecklund- whose moment of glory was once knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard- assures him that his time to shine is coming, a mismatched bout with a fighter 20 pounds heavier than him knocks out his fight. Luckily for him, a sexy and spunky bargirl, Charlene (Amy Adams), sashays into his life and helps him find the courage to accomplish his dream and remove the familial obstacles standing in his way. Russell's film thrives on these complex and thorny family dynamics- Micky's family see him as their last bastion of hope to earn some boxing cash, in particular his chain-smoking gin-drinking mom and manager Alice (Melissa Leo), whose distrust of outsiders including Charlene is as ferocious as her denial of her jewel-in-the-eye Dicky's crack addiction. Adding to the dysfunctional working-class family are seven loud and virulent sisters all stoically inclined towards Alice's opinions, amidst their cackle not one voice of reason. The verbal showdown between Charlene and Micky's exploitative female family for Micky's future is one of the beautifully staged sequences in the film, and Micky's difficult decision to free himself from their suffocating choke around his life is one of the many poignant moments here. But the heart of the story is still the fraternal relationship between Dicky and Micky, one the star of the family basking in his past glory and the other the wannabe-boxer living in his brother's shadow. Their subsequent emotional tug-of-war as Micky is forced to choose to do what's right by himself is heartrending in its brutal honesty, culminating in Micky's avowal to abandon Dicky as his trainer. Russell spends the first half emphasising the close bond between the two brothers, such that their separation and eventual reunion are easily the most affecting elements of the film. Against these troubled sentiments portrayed with a keenly felt rawness, Micky's relationship with the smart and tough Charlene who fights fearlessly against his family for his interests is a perfect counterbalance, and thanks to a terrific performance by Amy Adams, ends up tender and moving. Kudos to Adams for going beyond her usual perky type (e.g. ""Enchanted"" or ""Julie and Julia"") to play Micky's feisty other half with a will of steel- her unaffected performance will win you over right from the start. That Adams' stellar achievement in her supporting role may be so conveniently overlooked is testament to the quality of the acting on display in this film, which can be summed up in one word- phenomenal. In particular, you'll be astounded by perhaps Christian Bale's best performance to date, an exceptional accomplishment from one of the greatest character actors of our time. Bale dropped thirty pounds to play the skinny, fidgety older brother complete with receding hairline, bald spot and crack-addict teeth. It's easy to cast Dicky as the bad guy in the story, but Bale imbues him with such warmth and sensitivity that you can't help but feel immensely for his character. Bale keeps up a nervous energy about Dicky in every frame, and it is simply mesmerising to watch. On the other hand, Wahlberg has the less showy role as Micky, and though Dicky pretty much steals the first half of the movie, Russell makes it plainly clear by the second half that we- like Dicky's family- have very much been distracted by his antics. Micky is no less than the very core of the movie- it is his fighting spirit that eventually reunites the family. So while Wahlberg's performance may be low-key, it is still outstanding and counts among one of his best ever. Wahlberg's dedication to his craft is even more admirable considering how the actor started preparing for this role five years ago, building a boxing ring in his backyard, hiring two trainers on his own dime, and training hours each day to hone his skills. Beyond preparing for the role, Wahlberg's contribution to this film goes even further- when Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and subsequently Darren Aronofsky dropped out, it was Wahlberg who shaped the project from a studio film to a US$25m indie and got director David O'Russell on board. His efforts have paid off tremendously- Russell has created one of the best boxing dramas to date, a film that belongs in the league of ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky"". So much more than an underdog tale, this is a complex study of familial ties, the ones that strengthen and the ones that strangle. And thanks to astounding turns by Wahlberg, Bale and Adams, this ""Fighter"" is simply one of the best films of the year.",The Fighter 2010.csv

","There is something magic about Kieslowski 's cinema: his ability to expose the beauty and complexity of the human soul on celluloid print.
This is perhaps his most intimate and touching movie, an authentic classic masterpiece.
The double life of Veronique tells the story of two identical women living separate lifes in Poland and France. The furtive encounter between Weronica and Veronique triggers a meditation on life, destiny and the pursuit of love. 
Love scenes are shot with unique sensuality and delicacy (at times through a magnifying glass). No other director has been able to capture the essence and fragility of women the way Kieslowski does it here - with her etheral beautiful muse IrÃ¨ne Jacob.
This film will fill your soul and mind like very few others.",The Double Life of Véronique 1991.csv
damions72,1,25,43,16-Aug-07," this movie sucked!!!!!!
","This movie was so unbelievably bad I couldn't even watch it without thinking how much respect I had lost for the writers who I loved. That is until they wrote this garbage. Sure, there were some funny parts and I'm all about taking shots at religion, but the first ten minutes do not represent what this movie actually is. What this movie actually is is a desperate attempt at a fifth season show that turned out to be just another crappy new episode. this movie disappointed me for a reason that i am sure other fans are equally as disappointed. It didn't have the Simpson charm. This movie was made for any teenager who wants to go to the movies to get crappy humor you get from family guy(possibly the worst show of the generation)and to leave feeling satisfied. As a die hard fan of the show(which I can assure you i am) this movie did not hold a candle to the first ten years of the series. I'll go down the list of things that make the series great but for some unknown reason the writers kept out of the movie. 1.Principal Skinner. 2.dangerous Krusty merchandise. 3.gay jokes about smithers. 4.stories that actually came from the hearts of the writers. 5.homer getting drunk. 6.patty and Selma, and if homer screws up like he does in this movie, they are the two people who absolutely need to be there. 7.i am not 100% sure about this but i'm don't think homer even says mmmmm... followed by a food. The political commentary was so bad. i don't even know what point they were trying to get across. choosing the EPA as the villain was a huge srike-out for the writers. especially when the obvious choice to use sideshow bob was(for lack of a better word)OBVIOUS. it would have been so much more simpsonsy. the shots they took at the government were just directed at kids who hate the government but don't know why they hate the government. is it just me or was president schwartzegger just stupid? the shots at the government could have been way smarter if they just put George W. in the movie. or, to be loyal to the show, made it Rainer wolf castle. by putting in green day, Hillary Clinton, and an inconvenient truth parody, the timeless quality of the movie is destroyed. you can look at it and tell exactly when it was made, whereas the earlier episodes can be showed at any time and they would be as funny as they were at air-date. by putting in new characters that SUCKED like Lisa's boyfriend, and cargill, they needed to make room by taking out characters who make the show awesome. raunchy aspects like Bart's penis, homer's middle fingers and Otto smoking pot made the characters just not seem like themselves. by the way, Bart's subplot with Flanders was bull plop. it was just so NOT Bart. Marge's tape was so predictable. her and homer have been on this merry-go-round of lies so many times before, you know how its going to end, so why go through the charade over and over. ALSO, i'll have a hard time saying it but there was one word that made me so mad i wanted to rip my theater seat out of the ground and throw it at the wall.....sequel?",The Simpsons Movie 2007.csv

So much of this film became an introduction to an onslaught of numerous elements of creativity to the American cinema!! ""Gone With The Wind"" was one the first recognizable color films in Hollywood!! Clark Gable's parting goodbye of ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" spurred on a nefarious notoriety which correlated to a very real aspect of candid expression!! This quote by Clark Gable has been voted by this website as the most classic line in the history of all movies ever made!! This ending line of his was considered very dare devil back in 1939!! By today's standards, of course, this seems ridiculous!! ""Gone with the Wind"" became a legendary favorite with the movie audience immediately, and it has been an all-time classic ever since!! The epic tale of Sherman's march into Atlanta at the end of the Civil War sparked a precarious nostalgia with the average American in 1939!! Scarlett O'Hara (played by Vivian Leigh) was a fickle and self serving Dixie maiden with a comical resilience!! Clark Gable was the straight forward southern gentleman who had to piece everything together!! Olivia De Havolind played Melanie, the bastion of hope for the faltering south. Lesile Howard played Ashley, Scarlett's true love!! Ashley was the man with whom Scarlett was fixated on!! Such a tale of morose, and flippant, intangibles, became a dramatic aspect to this movie!! This innovative genre easily garnered a positively peculiar camaraderie with the movie audience!! Margaret Mitchell's novel acquired a new found fascination with the American people when it got presented as this spectacular extravaganza of a motion picture!! ""Gone with the Wind"" won for best picture in 1939!! I have not seen ""Gone With The Wind"" in quite some time now, but, I did enjoy the film the last time I viewed it. The cast, the costuming, and the classic lines to this film are all first rate!!

bahrom1,9,2,3,27-Dec-02," one of the best true story based films ever
","I don't like movies based on true stories. Fiction is a lot more cinematically compelling: the script can be changed at will - new characters or plot twists can be introduced, a couple of explosions can be added, endings can be changed to better please the audience and so on. With real story based films there is none of that and therefore it's almost impossible to maintain suspense or create the sense of purpose.""All the President's men"" is one stark exception. Despite being based on a true story book ( and a non fiction one at that!) it will keep you on the edge of your seat better than any thriller. This is mostly due to a good script and  excellent acting performances by Redford, Hoffman and Robards. For those from another planet, the story is about two Washigton Post reporters Bob Woodward (Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Hoffman) and their investigation of the Watergate scandal. Robards is also great as a tough Post editor Ben Bradlee. The story is told through the eyes of Woodward and Bernstein. The president and his men are never seen on the screen which makes their presence all the more sinister.Movie's portrayal of the day-to-day journalist routine is very believable. Unfortunately, some of the shadier methods employed by the two reporters in their quest for the story (which WERE described in the book) are left out. This makes their characters somewhat one-dimensional. However, this is a relatively small gripe. My only other regret is that the book and hence the movie end too abruptly before the story resolves itself. This is, of course, inevitable because the latter part of  Watergate  was dominated by different players than two Washington Post reporters. Not surprisingly, the book ""The Final days"" (also by Woodward and Bernstein) which deals with that period is not told from the reporters' perspective. Incidentally, ""The Final days""  is every bit as good as ""All the president's men"" and I wish someone made a movie based on that.All in all ""All the president's men"" is a must see classic that stood well against the test of time.",All the President's Men 1976.csv

gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,8,0,0,04-Jul-16," While definitely not a classic, Independence Day still retains it's heart on it's 20th anniversary
","In the 1990s and the early to late 2000s, Roland Emmerich, a German director, directed a few movies. Some of them were science-fiction, action-oriented, thriller, and disaster related. This film in particular.Aliens have come to our planet and destroyed most of our countries. Only a few people survived and with the help of the president of the White House, a military solider, and a nerdy scientist, they plan to fight against the aliens on Independence Day and destroy them once and for all.I'm reviewing this on Independence Day because considering that's how the battle between the humans and aliens started and the sequel just came out two weeks and three days ago. Anyway, this is a really good film. Nothing awesome or anything, but still good. I understand why the Nostalgia Critic and everyone else hated this film and Roland Emmerich in general, but as a big fan of action films that have heart, this one actually worked for me. There are some problems that I want to address before I can get to the good parts.First, the story. The concept is very fresh. The idea of humans fighting against the aliens as the part of patriotism is really original, but when it comes to the overall narrative, it's very formulaic and it does contain lots of clichÃ©s that plagued the later Roland Emmerich films. Second, some of the dialog does come across as clichÃ©d and unbelievably cheesy and the character development seemed to be lacking at times. That's it for the flaws. Now for the good parts.Despite what I said about the dialog, the overall acting is great. I mean, talk about a big cast of talented actors. Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Harvey Fierstein, Randy Quaid, and yours truly, Will Smith. All of these actors did really well and gives the characters some likability. Also, the one liners, aside from the cheesy and clichÃ©d moments, are really funny, the best coming from Will Smith.Also, the patriotism theme of the movie is presented really well and shows that if we work together as a united nation, we can defeat our enemies and bring peace to the world. The special effects, despite being a little dated, are still nice especially the spaceships designs which were also pretty cool. The action sequences are great and the explosions of all the countries are well-shot.The best part, however, would have to go to the music score from David Arnold. The guy composed some of the later James Bond films and even did some great music for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. His score here is beyond fantastic. It has heart, it has an epic tone, it has some strong action cues, and it fits the patriotism theme of the film perfectly. Particularly with the President's speech scene which made me shed some tears. That's all I have to say.Like I said before, I understand why the Nostalgia Critic and everyone else didn't like this film, but in spite of it's problems, I actually think this is a really good film for the fourth of July. Yes, it's a little cheesy, but to be fair, the 80s did had it's share of cheesy stuff and we were OK with it. So, overall, Independence Day is a really good patriotic science fiction action film and I think that it's one of Roland Emmerich's three best films, the other two being Stargate and the Patriot. To those who haven't seen it yet, go check it out and you'll enjoy the ride. Thumbs up. :)",Independence Day 1996.csv

The stereotypes that are present in even the best of war films are non-existent here, each character acts like a human being, and we do not need any flashbacks or dialogue to truly get a sense of who they are. The acting is fantastic across the board, as each actor knows their character inside and out, conveying a wide range of emotions without the use of dialogue. Nick Nolte deserves special mention for his scene-stealing performance as Tall, and the ferocity he brings to the screen grabs your attention without distracting from the rest of the film.

ironhorse_iv,9,5,6,31-Jan-13," Game on! Taking on life one game at a time.
","Wreck-It Ralph is such a good movie, and it really does show that Disney doesn't really need Pixar to make good animation movies. The film tells the story of the titular 8 bit arcade game villain named Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) who is tired of playing the villain, getting ostracize by his co-workers and force to live in ruins of his old stump. I like how John Reilly stumbles in his lines, but it still felt real to me. The movie does a great job visual to make it seem like 8 bit world, even to the point of using jerky motion that spoofs the limited animation cycles of 8 bit characters. He rebels against his role and dreams of becoming a hero. He sees that the only way he can be a hero is to game jumps to another game to win a medal to earn their respect. When the Arcade closes at night, video games characters in its games are allow leave their normal roles and are free to travel to other games through plugs that lead to a place known as Game Central Station, but have to return to their game in the morning, if not the game would seem broken, and in worst cases. Shut down. Since Wreck-It Ralph hasn't return, the game Fix-It-Felix Jr. is now in danger of just that. The hero Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) is starting to think that Ralph went 'turbo'. Going 'turbo' is name for a video game character whom went to another game, and try to sabotaged it, causing both games to be shut down. He soon find out that Ralph has gone to a first-person shooter game call Hero's Duty. Hero's Duty is a Call of Duty, Halo, type of game, lead by Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) where the game's winner receives a medal after fighting Cy-Bugs. Felix soon find out that he crash-land in another game called Sugar Rush, a kart-racing game similar to that of Mario Kart. Ralph searching for medal, meets Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a glitchy character whom like Ralph is shun by her game mates. Being PG makes Sarah Silverman so much more bearable, as she tend to too raunchy, but still Vanellope von Schweetz at first is such a annoying character, but the character's charm grow on you. It seems like a lot of critics hated her. I mean, she was annoying, but no more than a kid would be in most movies. Seriously, I swear most critics have completely mistaken her for an adult character because they constantly treat her like one, talking about how annoying she is when she's freaking nine! The way she acts is like how most 9-year-olds act! At least she was somewhat sympathetic. Ralph helps Vanellope build a kart to fight against it. King Candy (Alan Tudyk) the ruler of this world, refuse to let her participate, claiming that she is not really part of the game and her winning would cause the game to be shut down. Alan does a really good job on the voice, sounding more like Ed Wynn then his normal voice. This is where Ralph is force to decide about being the villain in the eyes of Vanellope to save her, or be the hero which will cause the end of both Fix-it Felix and Sugar Rush. A hard choice to pick. The final act has the most emotional and greatest twist to any movie that came out in 2012. The movie also contains a number of other video game references, to the point that I heard people calling this film the ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit of video games"" or ""Toy Story with video game characters"". The film includes characters, sight gags, and dialogues from games like Super Mario Bros, Paperboy, Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac-Man, Final Fantasy Q*Bert, Street Fighter and others. I geeked out quite a bit seeing them. My favorite reference is Metal Gear. How much cooler would the movie be, if the games were from a Flynn Arcade referencing Tron? To me the big name video game characters seemed a little tacked on because they didn't affect the story all that much, and that's a downer in a way. Of course the Copyrighted characters aren't in it for very long, but I think it's pretty impressive that they got as much as they did, but then again, this is the very growing media empire that is Disney we're talking about. While they didn't use the cameo characters to their highest potential. I almost feel it would have distracted the focus of the movie from the characters that the story revolves around to the established video games characters. I feel the cameos were not necessary, but at the same time it is icing on the cake. The movie works due to it's use of video game nostalgia, while building a clear colorful visual worlds where the characters can come in and out as they want. It's a visual spectacle. It was great for what it was: a child's movie covering adult themes with a video game background with humor that sharp. I think it would have been so much better if it focused on Ralph. He became a side-kick in his own movie when Vanellope comes in. There also so many story lines, and the romance of side-characters was so tacked on. Again, it's already a good film, but stating it could have been way cooler if it allow Ralph's journey to continue. Vividly creative setting and concept, extremely likable characters, but obscured by a kind of clichÃ© attention-grabbing comic relief character for parts of it, but worth watching.",Wreck-It Ralph 2012.csv

","As many of the other reviewers have stated, I will start by saying that I was a rabid Tarantino fan since the beginning. The operative word being ""was"" because I can't help feeling that the overstuffed creative genius has lost his mind. This film was at least an hour too long,twice as vulgar as it needed to be, liberally gratuitous with gore, unfulfilled plot lines and unnecessary sexual perversion that added very little, if anything at all, to the story.To be fair, I thought it started out with great promise in the opening dialog, setup and especially the cinematography. The music was impressive and did not blow out the dialog as many modern films do. But the last 45 minutes undid all of the pleasure I took from the performances by this (mostly) highly skilled cast. Why is Michael Madsen still getting work? He must have a personal services contract with Tarantino, Do we really need chapter headings for a film made in the 21st century? When a movie is this long, every extra second spent in the quiet darkness of a near empty theater house becomes agonizing while waiting for the payoff finale that never quite arrives. Could have saved at least a minute or two by dispensing with that crap.If this is the kind of message that we want to send about American art, it becomes easy to see why we are under fire from so many cultures.

","Before I begin, I would like to say that I would have given this movie 20 stars out of 10, but alas, the site does not allow for such an extension of gratitude.There have been many great (in the eyes of others, at least) trilogies and sagas of movies that have come and gone throughout history. Star Wars, Harry Potter, The Godfather, James Bond, Lord of the Rings, and many more. This movie brings an epic closure to arguably the greatest saga of them all, the Twilight saga. No other set of cinematic pictures comes even a shred of a molecule close to rivaling the sheer emotion, drama, suspense, action and, dare I say it, perfection, that Twilight has brought to many fans worldwide. What began as an interesting and unique alternative interpretation of vampires and werewolves (the sparkling of the vampires is the most imaginative character trait I have EVER seen) has ended in a message of love, unity and closeness, no matter how thick the lines of division are between one another. It truly shows that no matter how different we are, we can coexist, and we should. The love shared between Edward and Bella knows no boundaries, and when you have something like that, nothing can break it. There is even a friendship blooming between Edward and Jacob, once bitter enemies. It shows that we don't always have to hold such disdain amongst one another.The acting in this movie was superb, and executed perfectly, better than anything I have ever witnessed in any other movie in history. The dialogue must have been fashioned by the hands of literary Gods, because it was that compelling. Robert Pattinson does an amazing job at portraying a soul who can't help but love, even if the stereotypes and traditions pushed unto his kind do not allow for it. Taylor Lautner has done an extraordinary job showing us all that no matter what hardships you face, such as when Bella chose to be with Edward instead of him, it is not the end of the world, and something better can come from it. And, of course, the MVP of the movie, Kristen Stewart. Screw Meryl Streep, forget Katharine Hepburn, Kristen Stewart puts all female actresses before her to utter shame! It's almost as if when I am watching her portray Bella, I can FEEL her. It's like I've known her all of my life! She was truly meant to play this role, and she does a simply impeccable job bringing the emotion of Bella's character to the big screen.The CGI in this movie was top notch! I didn't even know until after the movie ended that the scenes with Renesmee as a baby were computer generated! She looked so REAL and believable! Not creepy in the slightest. I wanted to reach out and hug her! This is just a reminder of how truly developed our technology has become, and how photo-realistic and lifelike computer generated imagery is.The story was Shakespearean, never a dull moment. The best scene was at the end. One of the best action/fight scenes I have ever seen in a movie, with an intriguing twist at the end which I feel is the best possible direction the directors could take it.

","It makes a change from all those pumped up, perfect superheroes as the character of Hancock is drunken, ill-mannered and generally unpleasant in most aspects. The scenes with Will Smith playing his wisecracking best are the most memorable, although Jason Bateman is a good, solid support. The only thing I disliked is the way the film descended into schmaltzy territory in the latter part. In some respects I didn't care what happened to certain characters, it was just the typical Hollywood syrup ladled on. The plot weakened and the scriptwriters obviously thought lots of shoot em up action would compensate - and that's what lets Hancock down.

But for me, I believe that it is very important to do so, and the best way to honor the victims of 9/11. The film was stunning in it's realism. There were so many things that could have been done, in the making of this film, that would have made me very angry. I was actually pretty skeptical when I went to see it. But, the film is an absolute testament to the heroism that took place that day, as a small group of strangers chose to band together, and become the first line of defense in the war on terror. The film DOES NOT play politics. No matter what your political persuasion, you can appreciate this film. I think this movie is a great way to ensure we do not forget. I, like most people, did not think that I had forgotten.

","Prometheus is a highly anticipated movie, and many were looking forward to it, expecting a sumptuous steak, and instead it turns out to be no better than a common fast food hamburger.The plot starts out slow, and makes little sense, to the point of it being confusing understanding what is going on. This feeling is pervasive throughout the movie, with an incoherent plot, and it never makes much sense. When the real ""villain"" pulling the strings is revealed, its almost laughable. Some no-name actors in the major roles don't help matters. Michael Fassbender is the exception, and tries his best, but even he seems to make little impression as an enigmatic android. He is given too little to work with, it wasn't his fault.The only really good element in the movie is the scenery, which is visionary and occasionally awe-inspiring, with desolate and rocky vistas on an unknown planet, its quite well done. The advanced futuristic tech is pretty interesting as well, with cool gadgets and neat ideas about how the technology might be in the future.Everything else besides this is disappointing, and its a shame they couldn't have made the story and characters live up to the mysterious far away planet vistas and the distant lonely space atmosphere they created.",Prometheus 2012.csv

","With a remarkable energy, tension, and purely entertaining sense of nature, Limitless takes full advantage of its smart concept with just enough for you to believe in it. Bradley Cooper provides a good performance as always, with Robert De Niro and others providing mostly solid ones as well. The film starts a bit formulaic like, but it overcomes its tropes to become something truly original as it evolves into the complex sci-fi thriller you see until the very end. The cinematography is nothing too impressive for the most part, but it does have glimpses at some unique shots throughout. The script seems average for an adaptation point of view, but seems to coalign quite nicely in its now given form.

","Disney's magic is finally back. After so many inane, by the numbers movies by the once great studio, they come up with a wonderful, simple, poignant musical romantic animated comedy spoof, I know, all those genres wrapped into one might sound like a messy stew, but it's anything but, it is altogether wonderful.When I first saw the campaign for the film I though like many out there ""Gee, what will Disney think of next to squeeze bucks out of parents with small kids and girls that go gaga over Princesses?"" After a couple of months, I've seen the film 3 times, and was ""Enchanted"" with it, from start to finish.Probably the two best elements in the film are the screenplay, which did a wonderfully clever spoof on all the Disney mythology we've grown with since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Kudos to newcomer writer Bill Kelly.The other fantastic element is the tour De force performance from it's leading lady, Amy Adams. A great actress in the making, sort of reminds me of Diane Keaton, for her corky choice of characters, and the corky choices she makes with her characters. I first came upon her in Spielberg's Catch Me if You Can, she caught my eye as an interesting actress. Years later, with already an Academy Nomination under her belt, she is proving herself to be a great actress. Her comedic timing, her range, her screen presence, and her surprising vocal and dancing skills amazed me, and totally locked the film, she might be the most important cog of the whole production.The cast was altogether fantastic, Grey's Anatomy Patrick Dempsey was a smart choice, James Marsden was brilliant as Adams counterpart, it's always a pleasure to see Susan Sarandon, and Timothy Spall was a delight, surpassing his apparent character actor persona, established by his collaborations with Tom Cruise. Idina Menzel was slightly underused, being the great Broadway vocal she is, she could have had a musical number, or record a song, but she was great nonetheless.Speaking of Broadway, they really hit the spot on me with all the Broadway locations, displaying such signs as Hairspray, Chicago, The Color Purple and The Producers. The film does play out as a wonderful Disney Broadway musical. And though the film is not as mesmerizing as Beauty and the Beast(I leave that price to Brad Bird's Ratatouille), Enchanted is wonderful on it's own terms.Kevin Lima also did some clever directorial choices, like changing film format from Academy Ratio to Widescreen, to classic by the book Jerome Robbins choreography and staging(that comes full force with the showstopper ""That's How you Know"").The score is the cherry on top, it's was fantastic to hear, finally, a new score from Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, they were connected with Disney's Golden Era of Late 80s, and 90s, we owe many of the classic Disney scores like Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin and The Little Mermaid to them, it was amazing to have them back, with a killer score, that shows they have not lost their touch for music and lyrics, all of the themes are inspired, and the songs stick with you, Kudos you masters, you guys pulled through yet again, I smell a classic.Although it's early, I would definitely call Enchanted the surprise of the year, a film that from it's campaign seemed dull, predictable and by the numbers, but showed me and many people wrong.Disney and Pixar seem to have trouble with their marketing team, Ratatouille had the same problems with it's campaign, let's hope they can learn from this year.I highly recommend Enchanted, let's hope it will ""enchant"" you as it did me.",Enchanted 2007.csv

","From the very first scene, seeing Brad and Angelina receiving couples therapy, the chemistry between the 2 of them is so conspicuous and unbelievable. Once the opening credits have ended, your intuition leads you to believe that Mr and Mrs Smith has great potential...and you are certainly NOT misleaded.I caught this movie today with a bunch of friends, and it was unequivocal that along with myself all of my other friends enjoyed this movie to a great extent. The degree to which the humour has been integrated with the action is perfect. Angelina Jolie's seductive looks, and feminist 'chick' attitude make her perfect for the role - and to match this perfection, Brad Pitt very wisely made his decision to re-join the cast. I don't think i have ever seen such good chemistry between characters - and though in all the endless Oscar nominated and winning movies, their producers boast about 'chemistry',none are exactly conspicous. Brad and Angelina - are brilliant - and its a movie worth watching again.The supporting cast seem weak as opposed to the protagonists. Vince Vaughn was cast for even more comic relief, and to a certain extent overacted and seemed unwanted! Adam Brody who would have shown up on set thinking he was on the set of 'The OC' gave a Seth Cohen-ish performance, and Kerry Washington took on opposite role when compared to the performance she gave in 'Ray.'

Schwag09,10,2,2,22-Sep-17," Perhaps the best Vietnam War film ever created
","Apocalypse Now is a deployment to war-ridden Vietnam on acid. It's an exploration of human darkness with the faint scent of napalm in the air. A glimpse into sweltering madness only to turn around and question whether you've entered the rabbit hole yourself. When you're done watching it you'll wonder whether Francis Ford Coppola's best work was in fact behind him. Another of the greats that detailed a bloody excursion in the South Pacific; think Full Metal Jacket, The Deer Hunter, and Platoon. However, despite being an ever-popular topic of film, Apocalypse Now presents a unique perspective on the war as it adapts a previously unrelated story.Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on an ill-defined mission into Cambodia to hunt down Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). A mission wrought with inefficiency and bureaucracy eventually begins to wear on Willard. Kurtz is wanted for murder, but ""Â… charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets in the Indy 500."" During Willard's painstaking trip up river he slowly discovers more about the mysterious Kurtz and the nature of this horrific war. How can you destroy and man who's already destroyed himself? To what lengths will we go to maintain sanity in an insane place? Kurtz flows with the river and sways with the jungle like an omniscient, omnipresent ghost. The familiar puttering of the boat engine is our only form of solace as the vines begin to wrap around us and the water appears to pull us upriver.The War is put on display as a series of decisions made by four-star generals sitting in air-conditioned offices somewhere. An attempt at traditional war during exceptional circumstances. Desperate times don't call for moderate measures. Kurtz is the wild card and Willard is sent to clean up after him before he becomes a wild card himself. If the Vietnam War was an asylum, the inmates would surely be running it.Overall, Coppola provides a thought-provoking adaptation of Heart of Darkness. The contemporary nature of the film makes it more approachable than the original story. Despite becoming somewhat of a case-study of movie production problems during filming, Apocalypse Now is undoubtedly one of the best films to come out of the 20th century. It is often the most trying times that provide the most artistic inspiration, and this film is certainly a testament to that.",Apocalypse Now 1979.csv

","Deja Vu is more than a little misrepresented in it's trailer. I mean it is an action film by Tony Scott, it does star a host of big stars including Denzel Washington but the plot and idea is far more science fiction than it ever presents. From watching the trailers I had no idea that Deja Vu revolved around time travel. That being said Deja Vu happens to be one of the best action films of the season with an original, well connected plot, easy to follow but complex and intelligent story line and some strong performances with some small flaws to them. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington had something in common to me...I did not like either of their last films...Domino or The Inside Man so I wasn't sure if the two of them together were my mix but the strong, brilliantly written storyline drew me in. Scott filmed and captured New Orleans like few directors good and uses that setting to really make a difference in the picture and not just use New Orleans ""because."" Denzel Washington leads the cast as almost too brilliant ATF agent Doug Carlin. Now Washington is a brilliant actor, I have seen him in some brilliant roles but his ego has pretty much seeped into every performance he has and drags down his characters and makes them often unlikeable. Carlin can spot a clue from the ground on the bottom of a bridge in the air. He's just REALLY good at his job which is fine but Washington gives a distinct air of conceit which makes him annoying. But he still commands a certain screen presence so it works. Val Kilmer plays a supporting role, and a good one, as Agent Andrew Pryzwarra who puts together a team of his choice to investigate a brutal terrorist bombing that kills many Marines and their families on a ferry. Kilmer is great and the conceit he once carried with his characters is gone and has been gone since Batman Forever making him a decent strong actor in what he does. I would have liked to have seen more of his character in this film. James Caviezel is dark and brilliant, and downright evil as Washington's nemesis and the terrorist bomber Carroll Oerstadt. Paula Patton is also fairly good as the victim of the bomber who just needs her out of the way.Small clues are dropped randomly right from square one in the film that won't be connected or make sense until the very end of the film. Time Travel doesn't truly happen until almost 3/4 of the way through the film but still the story is being set for the future plot. Time Travel films can be very difficult making sure things match up and dealing with time paradoxes and the likes but Deja Vu does a very good job keeping tabs on the details. Throw in a few very thrilling car chases and an even more thrilling murder mystery and it makes for one of those must see movies that come out every once in awhile.

It's just it hasn't taken the time as well as the first film.Biggest draw back are the special effects, the flying cars, which are far too clearly just that: special effects.

My personal feeling is that if you watch the longboarding scene with wonder and joy than this will be a powerful film to you and easily a film that touches you. If not then this is probably not the film for you. Walter Mitty starts out slow and in this slow beginning there are many crucial details to pick up that make more sense as the film begins to pick up. The film truly comes alive as Walter plunges into the icy waters of the arctic. I can't help but think of it as a metaphorical plunge into the unknown, with salvation of one type or another as the only possible outcomes.As some have noted the daydreams go away mid-film. That is the point. As Walter begins to experience life in the truest sense he has no need for daydreams. I honestly felt that this is the entire point of the Film. Another reviewer stated that Walters real-life adventures are more entertaining than his day-dreams. To this I agree entirely. Walters life sequences are unrealistic, beautiful and captivating. There is no real possibility that they would happen and yet they are shot so beautifully that they are easy for US, the audience to have our own Walter Mitty day- dream moments. In those moments we think about and take stock of our life. I think that this is the real power of the film is to reflect on moments of the film. From the major scenes to the closing credits and their uniqueness. The credits and photography are the most beautiful I can remember seeing on film.

Usually second and third installments don't live up to the expectation of the first film and in this instance that is still the case, but only by a short way. This, as a third outing for the MIB duo, lived up to the trailers and is one of the best sequels I've seen for a long time. It's not as good as the first one, sure, but isn't at all bad. The jokes aren't so funny, or new, and Will Smith isn't as ""Will Smith"" as usual but the content of the story makes up for that.This is about time travel, which I always like. The SFX were excellent - especially all the different aliens - and the homages/references to famous people always make me laugh. Did you know all models are from the planet Glamouria? Anyway, I digress. Time travel. It's about time travel and that part of the action is cleverly done. I liked how there was more heart and soul to this one, and we learn a little about Agent K. Emma Thompson was rather good, but I think my favourite character was the charming and cute Griffin, played by Michael Stuhlbarg, as an alien who sees many future permutations all at the same time. I think he brought the comedy to the film instead of Mr Smith! I don't know whether this is the last one that is being done, but if it is it ends well. There is scope for another one, of course, but I think it's a little tired now. The jokes and the patter has been done and there was little that was new, particularly.

","Although I was certainly glued to the screen and it had my attention so did the last shark I saw and I wasn't very comfortable with the shark either.The acting was great and the locations and costumes were very believable but apparently it wasn't meant to leave me with any sort of a comfortable feeling or a feeling that the soul somehow triumphs over the sort of adversity of being an impoverished people living under an evil dictatorship.Their lives are mostly tragic it seems. The film depicts a realistic depiction of how the main character gets seduced by the dark and powerful side if you will in a very smooth manner. Forest Whitaker was great as Idi Amin, but how much can you say about the character of Idi, personally I didn't see any redeeming value in his character. And James McAvoy as the doctor, was really depicted as a degenerating character himself, who seems to have a bit of redemption on the way but certainly nothing that would give anyone a glow at the end of the film.I think the film was well done and although probably accurate, other than reaffirming that yes Idi Amin was a really bad egg just as we thought and treated his people very badly I fail to see it's purpose. Hopefully the film is making money and driving the economy, that would at least serve as something positive. So although Forerst Whitaker portrays the Evil Idi as a Charismatic leader and truly lights up the screen I failed to see much value in it. But hey give it a chance although I wouldn't take a girlfriend or the kids. Personally I didn't sleep well afterward",The Last King of Scotland 2006.csv

","In the words of Arthur Fonzarelli (aka The Fonz), ""bull... makes the world go round"". This latest installment of Spidey and the critics' and the public's reaction are all testament to how true that is. Perfect proof that corporations are greedy (why a remake? why now and why so poorly done?), critics are stupid (really Roger Ebert? because the origin story takes up an hour of screen time it is somehow ""better""? you are crazy!) and the public will believe hype and has a very short term memory (really, this one has more humor or the action scenes were better than the first installments? No way in Heck!). This is a entertaining movie...I'll give it that. The origin story has a few nice new pieces to it. The bad guy is somewhat interesting. The actress playing Gwen is outstanding. Yes, all true. But while the Toby McGuire installments may not have been perfect, they had great drama, great buildup of origin story in 1st installment, the depth of the characters and the inner-turmoil they all felt was very real, and they did it while making you feel it was all believable. After watching this at no time did I ever have an emotional attachment to Spidey, I never worried that he wouldn't survive the fight scenes, and poor Sally Field and Martin Sheen just over act themselves out of such a small role. All this is testament to how well done those Toby McGuire movies were (admittedly the 3rd movie was very poor on many levels but it still had humor and depth of characters). This version is more Nickelodeon or MTV after school special. Interesting enough to watch but they scaled down the good stuff to focus on high-school romance and drama and the whole concept suffers. If you find yourself enjoying this, don't be fooled by our society's epidemic of short attention span an lack of memory for important things from the past...go back and revisit Spiderman 1 and 2 and see what a REAL comic book superhero movie could be.",The Amazing Spider-Man 2012.csv

","'Princess Mononoke' is, quite frankly, one of the greatest animated films of all time. It's a classic, filled with terrific, eye-popping imagery, complex characters, and it is truly powerful in its dramatic impact. I came close to tears by the film's end.The first thing you will notice about 'Mononoke' is the animation. Animation god Hayao Miyazaki fills his screen with lush colors and bizarre fantasy creatures (personal favorite: Ashitaka's deer/horse steed Yakul). It's a far cry from the increasingly cheap animation we have in America. The movie is ambitious in its scale, and there are some truly magnificent set-pieces, like the near-apocalyptic ending.Also of particular note is the story. These characters and this plot are not black-and-white. Lady Eboshi may be cutting down the forests and angering the gods, but she truly believes it will help her people; she shows compassion to outsiders like lepers and prostitutes, and her regret at Ashitaka's cursed arm is sincere (she did, after all, cause the boar god's madness). San, the ""Princess Mononoke"" of the title, has shades of gray, too: Yes, we sympathize with her desire to protect the forest, but she is not innocent of bloodshed. Even Jigo, a con man/priest who wants the Forest Spirit's head for the Emperor (which is obviously a bad idea), has his reasons for committing what may be considered ""evil"".The English voice cast has divided people, but I liked it. Billy Crudup brings gravity and stoicism to Ashitaka, and Claire Danes is appropriately fierce as San. The standouts, however, lie in the supporting cast. Minnie Driver is perfect as Eboshi, bringing wit and elegance to the role; Gillian Anderson breaks from her Scully persona to deliver a powerful performance as ancient wolf god Moro; Keith David, one of America's most underrated actors, rules as the boar god Okkoto, and Billy Bob Thornton is very funny as Jigo. Thornton's Southern drawl has caused controversy amongst fans, but I think it adds to the character's charm.'Princess Mononoke' is a masterpiece.

I (stupidly) invited some co-workers to see this movie and sat in horror for seemingly never-ending minutes watching an essential soft-core porn flick slap me in my face with vulgarity, obscenity, and sexual insult.I was absolutely mortified to watch this movie with my friends on either side. I was made so uncomfortable by the never-ending use of the F*** word, the totally tasteless, not at all held back sex scenes, and the nauseating dialogue used to insult people or to refer to body parts. I am no idiot. I know these words exist -- I know people use them -- I know it is Hollywood -- I know some people just don't care or don't let it bother them -- I know some would say I should lighten up and just stay at home reading my Bible or something -- but this was ridiculous. I can tolerate cursing. I can tolerate sex scenes. I do plenty of both of those things myself in my life. But this movie was constant, extreme cases of both to the point that I was breaking out in cold sweats and wanting to leave the theater. I have never been this uncomfortable in a film... never.And the ""outrageous funny"" parts... well, let's just say I am still wondering where they were. Two... that's right... only two one-minute scenes tops made me chuckle. I was almost embarrassed to even find them funny considering how horrendous the rest of the movie was.If you are a parent, do not (do not) (do not) (do not) let your teenage child watch this movie if you can help it.

Remember too, that these are men that are all lifers, having no qualms about committing horrid acts. So what does Riply do? She goes to the mess hall to have lunch with them.

","If you like 'this sort of thing' then you will like this all bells-and-whistles Spielberg revamping of War of the Worlds. Spielberg's films tend to avoid deep meanings: they are true escapist story-telling. It's what he does best, and here he is well accompanied by Tom Cruise, an excellent actor who's calling is similarly 'unambitious' but who's reach doesn't exceed his grasp.Most people will know the basic story, so it needs an expert storyteller to make it fresh. It's set in the USA, in the present, and impressed me for its restrained use of special effects given the theme of invaders from outer space sterilising the earth of human 'bacteria' in order to settle. It starts off slowly enough, very laid back as we are eased into the characters of Ray Ferrier (Cruise), his estranged wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) and their two children, Justin and Dakota. The build up and invasion is almost secondary to the sense of rising panic, fear and ensuing desperation.Spielberg successfully manages the task of creating largescale film with a disaster convincingly global (see it on as large a screen as possible!) and there are plenty of opportunities for simple acts of heroism (adolescent Justin trying to save passengers on ferry), caring (a father doing his utmost for his rebellious children, even as he's scared out of his wits himself) and cutesiness (the young Dakota making every father's heart melt Â– and the acting of Dakota Fanning is one of the great child performances of the year).The actual aliens and their ships are impressive enough, but not ostentatiously so. Two thirds of the way through, Tim Robbins makes an appearance as an ambulance worker and his screen charisma makes an excellent balance to Cruise who could otherwise be too all-engulfing.Spielberg manages to wind it all up before it gets boring (running time is mercifully under two hours). As a fun ride, War of the Worlds is slick, thrilling, and worth every minute Â– but has little substance once you've left the theatre.",War of the Worlds 2005.csv

The sheep in question...is The Expendables 2.I had the pleasure to view and quickly forget the first entry and wont be coming back that road again, but high ratings of the second entry made me bit curious, so i gave it a go. Big mistake.First i need to state that although i do not feel that way, i am probably an intellectual.Like to disguise this fact by viewing some movies for their pure entertainment value.Guess the level of that one should fit into three starts this movie deserves. Maybe i am being too generous, since i would like to level down the high rating of this rubbish. Now...This movie can be watched once if you got nothing better to do with your life, although it exist for simple purpose...that is to give some thick pay check to some pensioners that are running short on elderly allowance.It is however an improvement to its first entry.Gone is shaky camera,bad language,cheap locations and chaotic action.It actually looks in the beginning, that it might be fun.The opening sequence is sort f fun in brutal,life disregarding way,with few inside jokes /i did enjoy the funny lines sprayed on their cars...coming soon, knock knock./Silvester Stallone does look like having a prostate problem, trying hard to hold his urine for the period of longer shots,with a bad wig and cardiovascular coronation and everything. The rest of the cast is sadly left behind in most scenes,Jet Li disappears after fun scene with frying pens for the rest of the movie.And the person being saved at the end is no other than BIG Arnie /Yes he is back and we'll be reminded of that several times during the movie/and yes it is kind of embarrassing.But this is a pointless fun movie, so lets not dwell on details and move on. After forgettable plot exposition and many minutes later,we meet this movie Villain. Jean Claude Van Damme. Now although most of these 80's dinosauruses looks like they have been through lots of punches in their times and need retirement...he as the villain holds a steady ground and stands up as a character and not an caricature. Hemsworth brother Liam is also likable character,but is expanded in a memorable way and gone of sight too soon.The heroine and romance /?/interest is also quite flat and implausible fighter...but so is most of this plots action. Well we are not here to think.Lets be fair and state that most characters get at least one scene worth of their appearance. But some of them do stand up and deserve more. Dolph Lundgren was the best and should get a chance as a lead role again somewhere. Jason Statham fight scene in the church.Bruce Willis fires few shots too.Also Chuck Norris makes good parody of himself in over the top scene, that is actually funny as it is ridiculous and him being the oldest of the bunch, appears as the freshest of the lot.But the boredom gap between exposition and final Battle is wide and numbing.Gives one lots of time for laughing at impossible plot development /A huge 5 tons plutonium mine with trams and everything,being dig by handful of villagers, whilst their estranged wives sit at home,learning to speak fluent English...and country government does not even notice/Anyway...all gets saved by one man Commando Arnie,that does look like a bad waxwork of himself that really should have stay in the museum as the rest of all.As lines and shot references /death man going through the x-ray scanner=Total recall/ grows every so repetitive and self serving.Final shoot them all sequence goes way beyond of all that. Suddenly we are watching a parody of our once beloved action heroes...actually acted by them...an expensive joke if you ask me.But maybe i got it all wrong and this is a parody and not a serious action movie and maybe i should stick with Bunuel and avoid movie like this.I am sure there are many kids that will find this movie revolutionary and simple folks find it mind blowing and i should join these guys in the museum...who knows, i need to let you people to judge for yourself.Thank you...",The Expendables 2 2012.csv

It has its highlights but never feels like an actual movie, more like a series of golf-themed comic vignettes from the stars of the early Eighties. Speaking of which, I can think of few movies as dated as this one - it is as resolutely Eighties as Mr T, Joan Collins' shoulder pads and Kenny Loggins who (surprise, surprise) pops up on the soundtrack.Welcome to Bushwood Country Club, an exclusive resort with a golf course and spa facilities. Owner Judge Smails (Ted Knight) likes to maintain the club's high standards and is deeply put out when obnoxious new member Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) comes along for a round or two. But Smails has other concerns beside Czervik - a troublesome gopher continues to evade the best efforts of deranged grounds-keeper Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) while semi-pro Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) tries to teach young caddie Danny (Michael O'Keefe) a few lessons about life and love, possibly involving Smails' flightly niece Lacey Underall (Cindy Morgan).""Caddyshack"" is a frustrating film in many respects. The undoubted highlight is Murray's battle against the gopher which seems to be the only constant throughout the film. For example, I got the feeling from the opening that Danny the caddie would be the film's focus but as the film goes on, I got the feeling that the script lost interest in Danny and focused more on Webb and Czervik. And sadly, the film's fatal flaw lies in its pro- and antagonist - Knight is too stuck up but is nothing like as annoying as Dangerfield who you're supposed to root for, which is something I simply couldn't do. He delivers his lines way too fast and overacts as though its the only thing he knows what to do which I can believe. The true stars are Murray and Chase and personally, they aren't in it enough for me to enjoy the film any more.I have other issues with it as well - the comedy only really works in fits and starts and the main characters in the plot don't engage you in the same way that Murray and Chase's do. There isn't a real plot line in the movie which also doesn't help things and the humour is mostly childish and toilet-based.

moviemanMA,10,1,3,23-Jan-06," Neighborhood Watch
","Murder is not one of the words that comes to mind when the talking about a neighborhood. A neighborhood is supposed to be a secure, warm, and inviting place that a person can come to after a hard days work and know everything will be alright. In the world of Alfred Hitchcock, it's everything but.Rear Window is the story of L. B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart), a photographer who is currently incapacitated due to a broken leg. He must stay at home and wait until it fully heals to get back out into the world. The only pleasures he has is talking to his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), spending time with his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), and looking out his window into the courtyard of his apartment complex.Even though Jeffries can be considered a ""peeping Tom"", his motives are simply out of boredom and curiosity. All he has are the lives of the other tenants and watching them play out. There is the dancer he dubs Miss Torso. There is also the ever depressing Miss Lonelyheart. The Songwriter and the Newlyweds also live their lives outside Jeffries window. The apartment that particularly catches his attention belongs to that of Lars Thorwald. He suspects that he has killed his wife.All of his accusations are simply based on what he sees, not what he hears. Stella and Lisa both think he is crazy and should stop snooping before it consumes him entirely. Before long he has his friend Detective Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) investigate what is going on over at Thorwald's apartment. The stage is set for a thrill ride through a pair of binoculars.Hitchcock's use of the camera is some of the most creative to date. Almost the entire movie is filmed in Jeffries's apartment. TO make the shots look like what Jeffries is seeing through the binoculars. This same type of shot is used in Roman Polanski's Chinatown. It's an excellent first person perspective. It gives a more realistic quality, like someone could actually be seeing this.Hitchcock also uses a lot of sounds that would be heard in an urban area. The sounds of the street, the other tenants, and what elements of nature remain. The music is used to enhance a shot or a feeling that is trying to be given off.Stewart and Kelly's performances are mirror images of what a couple would be like. They fight, love, and go through the motions of just everyday life. As Stewart's character gets more and more involved with what is going on, so do the other characters. Their mood changes from concerned for Stewart to concerned for Thorwald's wife. This film takes a real setting, real people, in an extraordinary situation. Invasion of a person's privacy working towards the common good is a very peculiar subject to be shown, but Rear Window does it. It's a roller coaster of emotions where the suspense is enough to lift a person out of their seat. Each frame more engaging than the previous. Hitchcock proves that a fascinating story and a little imagination can go a long way.",Rear Window 1954.csv

","The movie uses a Sci-Fi vehicle, in part at least, to make some social commentary on South Africa's Apartheid past (not so subtly - but effective).The plot centres on how a ship load of alien refugees are treated by humans, using the corollary of how humans treat 'different' humans as the basis.It is based on a South African short film called 'Alive in Joburg' which in itself was inspired by the clearing/relocation of District 6 in Capetown in 1966.There is definitely a message about Sth Africa's apartheid past - I just hope Sth Africa's future doesn't emulate Zimbabwe's present.The film reportedly cost $30 million to make, and took $37 million on it's first weekend. Not bad.

Rick_Swift,10,55,102,09-Jun-11," Simply an AMAZING STORY!
","Swift shot: If you see this one in theaters, count yourself enlightened, if you wait to rent or own Blu Ray, consider yourself miserable. Because, trust me, if you wait til you are home to see this for the first time, unless you are exceptionally wealthy and have a veritable theater sized screen at home â€“ - â€“ you are going to be kicking yourself forever! Occasionally, every few decades or so, a film comes along that just fires on all cylinders and resonates with something inside you that hasn't been active since you were a kid. Super 8 manages to do just that, stir up imaginations I once thought completely dormant â€“ where the critical, cynical adult in me keeps the child bolted up in a dungeon called ""the impossible"". I want to thank EVERYONE who made this film a reality, and I wonder if Paramount knows just how fortunate they are to have some of the best film-makers to ever hold that title on their label? Set in 1979 in a steel town in Ohio, Super 8 essentially is a story about a group of friends, over the summer, dealing with a tragedy that one of them endures at the onset of the film. It has the feel of a Stand By Me script, though devoid of any narration or device that tells the story in the present. This film, again, is just an Amazing Story with a supernatural, monster-thriller, or sci-fi element tossed in to keep the characters constantly malleable and interesting.With great tragedy comes the need for great distraction, and Writer/Director J. J. Abrams gets this, and displays this, quite efficiently. Rather than let their friend, Joe (Joel Courtney) dwell on his personal loss, his gang of misfits, led by Charles (Riley Griffiths) â€“ who thinks he is the next Hitchcock or Romero â€“ comes up with a perfect distraction . . . a zombie film. At first some of the others think it a bit tacky to involve a kid who just lost someone close to be shooting a zombie flick, but they figure it might help him take his mind off of the loss as well. Not to mention, the girl who everyone is afraid to talk to, Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) has agreed to be in the film as zombie hunting detective, Martin's (Gabriel Basso) wife.It all starts off innocently enough, Alice steals her dad's car, without a license (rebels that they are) to drive them to the shoot, EXTERIOR: late at night, a train station, now closed. They run through lines, Charles delights in directing his friends, and he tries to get the most out of what he's working with. His friends are a great team, considering they are in middle-school, and they manage a level of professionalism that exceeds their years. Then, something happens, a crash, about an EIGHT on the butt-pucker scale (patent pending), which really sets the sci-fi or supernatural elements into locomotion.What happens next is all too easy to spoil, suffice it to say, something is not quite right in the steel town of Lilian, Ohio circa 1979. The Air Force, helmed by Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich) is somehow involved, Joe's dad, Jackson, the deputy sheriff, played by the exceptionally talented TV-actor (Kyle Chandler) is suddenly put in charge and the misfits find themselves caught in the middle of everything but are still hell-bent on finishing their film to submit to the Cleveland Film Festival . . . ah great aspirations must start somewhere, but Cleveland? Comedy and tragedy is spliced into the story masterfully in short little bursts with character dialog, incredible action sequences and excellent acting. And, someone check me if I am wrong, but did they cryo freeze the blond-haired brat from the 70â€²s version of The Bad News Bears and place braces on him to hide his identity? Because, that kid Cary (Ryan Lee) in Super 8 is his clone! Super 8 is a high-tech drama with a childish heart that reminds you what it was like to build models, pine for the prettiest girl in school, and to never stop fighting for those you love. It is a film about loss, grief, struggling to cope and acceptance, all with a ""twist"" just to make things more interesting . . . or rather, AMAZING!",Super 8 2011.csv

I was blown away by the sheer entertainment value of this movie.The story is basic sci-fi mumbo jumbo, but who cares?

Bruce Willis once again does his tough-guy persona, and he shows that he's still got the goods to kick butt and crack jokes. Gary Oldman, in a strange idea, has a Texas drawl and he gives another over-the-top bad guy performance (he also has the worst hairstyle known to man).

It you get motion sickness from dizzying camera work and whiplash-speed cutting, then you may be in for a tough time. I saw the 2D version, and gawd knows what the 3D full on version is like.While everyone gets several chances to shine it was Scarlett Johanssen who stole the show for me.

Yeah, some have quibbled with the Banner/Widow ""romance"" - it may not flow from the previous movies but in this all-action slug-fest it gives the characters some depth and the film some time to breathe.So, a rushed story aside, get set for spectacular action, special effects galore, and the cinema of super-hero bombast in all its glory...",Avengers_ Age of Ultron 2015.csv

","I had huge expectations for The Martian, i just love this kind of movies, and of course the combination of Ridley Scott and an ensemble cast like this is just pure perfection. And it was too bad that the film wasn't in Imax theatres. But, did the film meet my expectations? Well, it sure did!The film has this feeling, a feeling so unique that it's like nothing i have ever seen, and it's definitely one of the most addictive films i ever saw. From the very first frame, it grabs you with such a force it never lets you go, even when you leave the theatre. It just stays with you. And its impossible to take your eyes off the screen. The story is just perfect, the setting is unique, the cast is beyond perfect, and i don't know if this can be a spoiler but if it is, **WARNING** SPOILER AHEAD: Sean Bean doesn't die on this one!I Know, its insane! Obviously Matt Damon shines brighter than the sun in here, but the other actors also shine a lot. And Ridley Scott is in top notch, while i would change some camera shots (as usual in his films) i understand his perspective.Basically this is a film about one man trying to survive in Mars and get back home after it was left there because everyone thought he was dead. And even if we get a lot about the people that are trying to get him back home and a little about his crew that left him there, this is basically a biography about Matt Damon's character, and i really would like to have seen much more of the crew, but i understand what The director and writer did. This film is unique in every way possible, but i guess ultimately what makes him so unique is the main character, because instead of the usual depressing character in this situations (understandably of course!) here, we get an above normal optimistic character that simply put doesn't want to die and deals with problems with an optimistic way that delivers tons of gold comedy. This makes for a much more different narrative, but of course makes the character feel a little off, because it doesn't have those depressed moments, or looks like his suffering with the loneliness or the problems. While i would enjoy some of these moments, or to know a little more about this character, i also understand the goals here.And is here that i think the film should have some more complex emotional moments, that explored more and deeper, some themes and characters. And to me this is why after only one view, that the film isn't perfect, even though i probably will give it a 10 because i think i loved the film so much it makes me forget that.The film has a rushed feeling, that it would be overcomed if the length were bigger, and the ending, particularly, isn't among my favourites because of this. But its nothing that compromises the quality of the film.The production values are just beyond perfect of course, or this wouldn't be a Ridley Scott film. From the hauntingly beautiful visuals, to the insanely realistic production design to the thrilling score, it's just pure perfection!This is one of the most original and unique films ever and it is instantly a favorite, it has such a strong force that you are pulled to its orbit right from the beginning. And it will make you think a lot after you leave the theatre. Thrilling moments abound, comic moments to spare, and plenty of drama makes this one of the best films ever, And is insanely realistic you just forget you are watching a film, and think that this is a documentary about a real life event.

The European locations and the cinematography all seem promising, but the movie falls flat pretty fast and stays there. There are scenes of imaginative gore, there are some beautiful women taking off their shirts, and that's about it. The film completely lacked suspense because we weren't given much of a reason to care about the characters. I found myself completely disengaged. Sure, I'll squirm when you show me someone getting chainsawed, but is that all there is? Increasing gruesome effects and nice camera work does not mean you've got a story. The main characters, who, in theory, we should be hoping will survive all the bloodshed, come off like shallow, annoying frat boys, but not SO annoying that you want them to die, which would at least be some way to connect to the movie. Horror movies should not just be horrifying, but suspenseful as well, offering the audience a reason to think (or yell) 'Don't go in there you idiot!'

","As an enthusiast for film in every aspect, I truly believe this French drama to be a masterpiece. Beginning with the incredibly well suited score by Ludovico Einaudi which captures the essence of the film I was initially unsure what to expect. The opening scene was majestic and beautifully filmed with dramatic cinematography and introduced the clever comedy throughout the picture. The true story that the script is based off may not at first glance seem relevant to many people, however I realised that actually this film notes a lot on differences in culture and creates a character for Driss, the protagonist who is low in the socio-economic scale, that expresses a lot of ideas that we might not realise and shows that the ways of the wealthy are not only largely different on the surface but deep beneath are much like that of any class. What really made this film get the rating I have given it is the heart that it has, Driss and his friend Philippe have masterfully scripted conversations which have a beautiful mixture of melancholy and satire which gives the film a very natural sense and elevates the fluency of the pacing. Many scenes I found myself bursting with laughter as if i were having a laugh with close friends, the film feels very personal because of this and the accompaniment of Einaudi's soft yet tenacious performance generates a homely atmosphere throughout. the beautiful cinematography carefully mimics that of a persons sight, with artistic blurring and intriguing angles. These angles and camera effects bring you deep into the character of Philippe, whom is paralysed beneath his neck, as it feels much like his view. Philippe's character tends to stare out into the distance and the filming resembles this aspect. Finally this incredible film is accompanied by acting which feels very real and each actors style worked perfectly with the character that they played. the film as an entirety felt natural and real and the superb acting was the heart of the greatness.",The Intouchables 2011.csv

letande,1,183,334,03-Nov-18," A crime against Freddie and his memory.
","First of all, I didn't really want to go. After all that happened with this movie and after everything that Queen members said, I expected it to be bad. Very, very bad. But then I saw all those positive reviews and thought ""Hey! Maybe it's actually good? I mean, miracles happen from time to time and I don't want to miss something good based on something as epic as Queen"". So, I paid for a ticket. I was a fool...Bohemian Rhapsody is exactly as I expected it to be. Even worse, actually. And the biggest problem with the movie is the fact that the band didn't want it to be a movie about Freddie. I mean, sure, they're all very talented musicians and it's probably painful to live their lives in Freddie's shadow, even while pretending that the band still exists without him. No matter what they do, the people think ""Freddie"". So, sure, I can see WHY they didn't want this movie to be all about him. The problem is... there was no other way. The story of Queen is the story of Freddie Mercury. Who, aside from many other things, was a very complicated person. And the only way to make a movie about Queen and Freddie is to focus on Freddie's inner world. The same way that the First Man focused on Neil Armstrong. Remember how people said a lot of bad things about that movie just because it didn't focus on the American flag? But that was exactly why the First Man was so good. It wasn't yet another movie about American heroes in space. It was a movie... about... Neil... Armstrong. Bohemian Rhapsody does exactly the opposite. It turns Freddie into another character of the show. One of the many. And it's one of the things that pretty much ruin the movie.Like I said, Freddie was a complicated person. A true artist with the unique soul. And without even trying to look deeper into his soul, this movie makes him... well... a freak. Personally, I consider it a crime. Not because I'm one of those crazy fans, but because he deserved more... WAY more than what they did to him in this movie. And it's not about Rami Malek, no. The man is quite good and I hope that this movie will be good for his career. The problem is - writing sucks. Hard. We see Freddie saying and doing things, but we don't have a slightest idea about why. WHY does he do all that? How does he feel? Remember Sully? The movie about Capt. Chesley Sullenberger? Remember what Tom Hanks did there? Sully didn't have any action scenes, the landing sequence was quite short too. The whole movie was about Tom Hanks showing Capt. Sullenberger's feelings in his eyes. Clint Eastwood directed it in a way that we didn't even need words there. Tom Hanks' eyes and the right directing were enough. Bohemian Rhapsody? Nothing like that.Thanks to an awful writing and the pressure from the actual band, it turned out to be a movie about a group of cool and friendly guys and a freak with a superiority complex who were unable to do the things in a normal way. Meaning, feelings, thoughts, emotions... this movie doesn't have anything of that. It aims for a single thing - a bright and exciting picture. Something that is FUN to watch. A bright picture that shows us funny scenes of how famous songs were made, Freddie saying funny and shocking things to people, etc. Even the gay part is surprisingly dull and shallow. One kiss here, one hug there... No feelings involved.To make things worse, even though the movie is pretty straightforward, it's full of lies. Very convincing lies that make the band look even more cool. There are characters that weren't even based on actual people, there are scenes that weren't even based on actual events, etc, etc, etc. As the result, the movie feels like a convincing something that was ordered by Brian May and Co to make them look better. And that's exactly why the one should never ever involve the actual people in biopics about them. They'll want things done in their way. And it'll destroy any attempt to make something real. Brian and Co wanted a colorful yet shallow movie full of fiction, in which the cool British guys make a fool out of the EMI executive, who never ever existed in real life, they've got it. Bohemian Rhapsody is sure bright, colorful, it looks amazing, actors are quite good, even though many of them are TV actors, the concerts look shockingly close to the real deal, and yet, it's an awful movie. And the final scene (which is Live Aid, by the way, don't expect any Innuendo depression in this movie) is a nice example why. They've literally re-created Queen's Live Aid performance. They had a lot of time for a long and very expensive Live Aid cosplay. And yet... they didn't have enough time to show us Freddie's complicated soul. I call it a failure. But again, I hope it makes Brian and Co feel better about their lives. Clearly, it's the true goal here.",Bohemian Rhapsody 2018.csv

Death (Brad Pitt) decides to spend a few days as a mere mortal and his target is a wealthy men (Anthony Hopkins). Little does he know that he'll fall hard for Suzan, the daughter of his victim. Now, he is confronted with a dilemma: to listen to his heart (and love Suzan for the rest of his mortal life), or to listen to reason (and to become once again the angel of death).The end lives you a bitter-sweet taste in your mouth. One one hand you're happy that he didn't take her with him (she would have died), on the other hand you cannot help but feel sorry for him, because he has to live her, to go back and continue his lonely existence.Brad Pitt is great in the role of Death. He is, as Suzan says: ""shy in the most seductive way and yet powerful"" When we think at Death we don't picture it as a blond handsome guy with a stunning smile. A men who likes peanut butter more than anything and who has the candor of a child. And this contrast is what makes the movie great.Anthony Hopkins is, as always, at his best. A elegant gentleman who has the wisdom of his age. A father who love his daughters more than anything. Who dares to face Death when he realizes that He wants to take Suzan with Him.Claire Forlani (Suzan) is perfect for this role. She knows nothing about Joe and yet she falls for him. She accepts him without any questions. I'll never forget th moment when she realizes who he is. The look on her face when she accepts the inevitable: ""you're Joe!"" she says smiling through her tears.Ok, enough!

","Whenever I hear this title I first assume that it means the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers musical, but this one is actually based on the same title as a song featured in The King and I, from director Peter Chelsom (Funny Bones, Serendipity). Basically John Clark (Richard Gere) has a good job as a lawyer, Beverly (Susan Sarandon) as a loving wife and a happy family life, but he seems bored by all of this and fancies something new. He passes it every evening, and sees the same beautiful woman through the window, so he decides one night to enter the place, a dance lessons class, and he signs up hoping to be taught by the woman, Paulina (Jennifer Lopez). He may instead be being taught by the older Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), and he is just as clumsy as other dance students, such as Chic (Bobby Cannavale) and Vern (American Pie Presents Band Camp's Omar Benson Miller), and for a while the woman he glanced at doesn't seem interested. After a while John does eventually get to meet Paulina, she only wants to teach dancing not have a date, but they do become good friends, to the point when he has fallen for her. He has been keeping the dance lessons a secret from everyone, all his friends and family, and eventually he has become really enraptured in the dancing as well, he is training for a championship Chicago dance competition. For this John is partnered with dancer Bobbie (Lisa Ann Walter), and he is against fellow dance student Link (Stanley Tucci), he obviously has Paulina watching from the audience, but he is unaware that Beverly and his daughter Jenna Clark (Tamara Hope) are there as well. This distracts him at the crucial point during the performance, and in the end he decides to quit, but his life returns to a happy normality, Linkn and Bobbie get together, Paulina gets a new dance partner for a Blackpool competition, and John and Beverly enjoy a dance together themselves. Also starring Stark Sands as Evan Clark, Richard Jenkins as Devine, Nick Cannon as Scott, Sarah Lafleur as Carolyn, Onalee Ames as Diane and Diana Salvatore as Tina. Gere is alright being reasonably charming as trying to escape his drab lifestyle, Sarandon doesn't get much to do at all as his wife, and of course Lopez looks gorgeous thrusting her moves and poking her bum out, even though her mood is low most of the time. If you are a fan of dancing films, and specifically ballroom, then I guess this has a fair amount in it to satisfy the eyes, as for the story in between it is lacking in originality, only the dancing is worth watching, otherwise it's probably only worth seeing the once, a slightly lame romantic comedy drama.

Loved the soundtrack as well, although wouldn't recommend the film to people sensitive to noise/gunshots.

","Admittedly, having been born in Austin and raised near Houston, I'm a bit biased. And being born on April 9, I had to go see the movie the second it came out! What a birthday gift! Still, I really liked this film - it's far superior to the John Wayne and Fess Parker takes on the Alamo.The directing could use some work; there are far too many close-ups of the actors' faces. The film could also stand to be a bit shorter. I daresay those are ""The Alamo""'s only major flaws. I don't think there was a bad actor in the picture. Perhaps the screenwriters' got things wrong with their characterizations, but the actors did exactly what those writers told them to do. Superb. The Dallas Morning Star reviewer called it intellectual and compassionate - I'm not sure those are the words I would use to describe the movie, but I won't argue with him. As far as intellectualism goes, the character development was perfect - most movies are sufficiently lacking in that department, yet it's really easy to spend too much time on character development. Even with at least five major characters to track, this movie walked that fine line perfectly.I don't know how accurate it is historically. With a few notable exceptions such as ""Thirteen Days"" and ""Inherit the Wind"", Hollywood routinely blows off history. It was nice to see the Col. Travis line in the sand legend ignored, as well as to see all our larger than life characters portrayed as fully human (which to me makes them that much more heroic). Also, the battle of San Jacinto was very well done. Perhaps that scene was a bit cliched, but I'm speaking in terms of accuracy with this paragraph.Since the movie only came out today, I won't spoil anything (obviously, the Alamo was a massacre but we kicked butt at San Jacinto - just like the Titanic sank. I mean I won't spoil any style specifics). I will say that, despite some critics' disapproval, I liked the way Davey Crockett went out. It wasn't quite John Wayne and the ammo dump, but it was every bit as heroic. The scene with his violin was great, as well. Both of them, come to think of it. I wouldn't ever think to cast Billy Bob Thornton as Davey Crockett, but he pulled it off. He took some getting used to, but after the first half hour or so I could see it. Dennis Quaid would have been more appropriate as either Col. Travis or Col. Bowie, but he worked as Sam Houston, as well.Is $7.50 too much for a movie ticket? Perhaps.

I must say that any film that blatantly  asks ""what is love?"" is in my book pretentious. The film also looks like a national geographic special on the animals of Guadalcanal except that National geographic specials are more fun to watch.

","The entire flick left a bad taste in my mouth. And this bad taste seemed very unnecessary. Even before the shock ending which has garnered much publicity and praise for its daring the movie wasn't working for me. First of all the character Thomas Jane portrays isn't very likable. Despite the fact that he's presented as a loving father and husband I just didn't buy into anything he did and could care less about him or anyone he cared about. The supporting characters didn't offer up anything and were either obstacles or mindless companions offering up little nuggets of useless plot driven advice whenever prompted by the screenplay. Perhaps the biggest issue I had with the film was the character development. When the crap went down, and it does pretty quickly, I found that all of the characters could be killed by the creatures and I wouldn't care in the slightest. In a film like this, bland unlikeable characters are a huge no no. There are some scenes which are moments of pure cinema and despite the lacking on the character development/likability end the film was very well made and the effects were intense and well done. Overall though I just can't see myself giving this anything but a half-hearted recommendation. Maybe I expected too much out of it, what with all the good word of mouth about it and it being Frank Darabont spearheading the whole thing.

Pitt answers quickly ""five years"" and is corrected by his wife ""six"".. with his genius reply of ""five or six years"" - not long after he asks where. ""Colombia, five years ago"" with her again ""six years"" - Pitt again replying; ""five or six years ago"", this tells everything about this marriage.John Smith works inside the construction side and Jane Smith is a system analyst, at least they pretend to be. Because what they really are; is assassins, both of them, without the other knowing. So, soon their next assignment is to kill each other, and this will certainly lead to a messy divorce...Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are both very pleasing in this full-on action-flick of a summer movie were it's all about entertainment. Filled with explosive action and very entertaining laugh-out-loud moments, MR. & MRS. SMITH does about everything right in it's ambitious scale. Brad Pitt is very pleasing as a comedian though Jolie works far better as a serious actor, and it's truly the first film I've seen her acting this well (except GIRL, INTERRUPTED that is). And Vince Vaughn is also very nice in the character as Brad Pitt's boss, living with his mum and being on high alert with a shotgun Vaughn alone creates true comedy here. With really nothing to complain about, the overall most impressing part is the great action sequences that takes place at different, great areas. Either it's Pitt vs. Jolie in their own house, or on the road co-operating with a open trunk and firing and shooting and blowing things up, it's always fantastic watching! Brad Pitt growing better and bigger as an actor every year does a great performance here and as said about Jolie, also she acts good here. And the movie never trembles, it's focus is razor-sharp inside action and comedy, and offers every entertainment sweet you can ask for. Brad Pitt's natural charm spanned around his messy John Smith and Angelina Jolie's cat-eyes in her terrible-cook Jane, taking this to the extreme together with the action twisted in with Latino rhythms at the end, cool! MR. & MRS. SMITH is truly a fantastic entertainment movie, nothing to say about that.Doug Liman still in the success of his Jason Bourne adaptations takes everything further here, and dodges in all of his director - strikes in between the flirting romance and lethal action scenes. Fine scenes as when Pitt and Jolie are dancing and checking each other for weapons is one of the many sexy scenes MR. & MRS. SMITH delivers with great confidence. Truly one of this summer's biggest and coolest movies! Very worth watching.",Mr. & Mrs. Smith 2005.csv

","While I enjoyed the animation and the style of the film, about an hour into it I became increasingly uncomfortable as the true roles of the characters began to emerge. I found the final plot to be somewhat incoherent and very problematic in terms of reinforcing negative gender stereotypes and un-empowering gender roles. For example, why is the main female character and an additional female character attracted to Howl when he is never around, highly volatile and outrageously needy? Why does the main female character give up her hat business to clean his castle? Why are age and weight the predominate indicators of social disgust and unattractiveness? Why does Howl's big scene displaying his love for the main character consist of little more than buying her gifts and showing off his power? Why is the broomstick the most considerate, caring male character in the picture and also the one that no one wants to be in love with? I have very little experience with children's films, but would like to think that a theater full of attentive, undiscerning children would be an arena that demanded a higher level of responsibility in terms of presenting characters that empower the viewers as opposed to propagate oppressive stereotypes.",Howl's Moving Castle 2004.csv

Doctor (as he so vigorously reminds people) Bill Hartford's (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman) wander through their own repressed sexual feelings in a series of unfulfilling and scandalous rendezvous. The protagonists are unerringly narcissistic, but in such an innocent animalistic way that I do not feel shame or disgust for their behavior, rather a detached understanding of their motives. It is almost a relief that the promised and foreshadowed tardy sex scenes never manifest on screen, as it retains the sense of purity in the exploration.

EamesTheForger,10,1,3,08-Oct-11," A violent, stylish film with a real heart; Refn is a director to keep an eye out for.
","'Drive', a film by Nicholas Winding Refn (Bronson), has the makings of a cult classic. Ryan Gosling plays a man who simply 'drives'. He performs stunts in vehicles for Hollywood films, but he makes his real money as a getaway driver. 'Drive' is a film of two acts; the first, in which the driver becomes involved with a married woman, Irene, and her son, sets up the second, in which he must protect her from chillingly ruthless mobsters. 'Drive' is one of those cinematic experiences that you pray will never end. So great is the atmosphere created in the film that it invades your thoughts for days after having watched it. Something about the slow pace, sleek visuals and electronic soundtrack transport you into this glossy yet dangerous LA underworld. The film is clearly influenced by classic such as 'Bullitt', 'Goodfellas', and 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly'. Despite this, 'Drive' is an absolutely unique piece of cinema which is certainly no less than the sum of its parts. Unlike many recent Hollywood offerings, 'Drive' is a film that is directorially bold. Nicolas Winding Refn seeks both clarity and originality in the film's key moments. The opening scene is a getaway chase, but instead of fast cuts and meaningless explosions, Refn treats his audience with more respect, creating a slow, tense escape scene which is vastly more satisfying than a simple display of technology. The reason this works is because the film carries genuine emotional suspense, and we care about what happens to the characters, something that is actually rather rare. Gosling's character, known only as 'Driver', is a superhero of sorts. Much like Spiderman or Batman, he has two personas: the quiet, caring stunt driver by day, and, when he dons his scorpion jacket, the cold, calculated getaway driver by night. As a character he is easy to admire. He is often silent, always thinking, and handles danger with calmness and skill. Despite the fact that he is on the wrong side of the law, towards the end of the film we see the driver as a victim of his own nature and sympathise. Irene's husband gets into serious trouble on release from prison, and the driver offers his assistance only to become tangled up in a seemingly never-ending web of organised crime. Be warned; the story darkens, yet of course continues to enthral.",Drive 2011.csv

It was that exiting. It sound's weired but I've felt a strange kinship to the mutants when I was watching the movie. The story just sucked me in and made me feel that close to the characters.

","After reading the book this film was based on, I was so excited to hear it was being made into a feature film with Brad Pitt as the star no less. I see now why Brad had the good sense to bow out of this project. I have to say the acting and cinematography was fine, the script is what sinks this in the mud.
The book went into detail about Fawcett learning his explorers trade at the RGS and made it so fascinating! The film touched on the most mundane minutia of Fawcett's time with the RGS. It made me wonder why they even bothered with it at all? Most of all I was ready for a great Jungle story with all its horrors and heroics.
It was as if someone read this wonderful adventure book, picked out the boring bits ( there weren't many ) and made a film with the same name. Like filming War and Peace with the ""War"" left out. The book made sense of everything the film didn't. The why's and the reasoning behind everything Fawcett and Nina did. The book also told the story of the author's research, a back story almost as interesting as Fawcett's.
Facts that were intentionally deleted to make the film more appealing. Such as Fawcett being bald in his twenties. The lush head of hair Mr Hunnam sported, bothered me as much as if you had an actor with Dreadlocks play Winston Churchill. The WW1 trench scenes, the ""over the top"" charge, in reality never happened. Fawcett was an artillery Lieutenant Colonel pushing 50 and never got close enough to the front lines for any of those clichÃ©d heroics. That's even if the brass would have let him try them in the first place.
Lastly Fawcett's Son's friend Raleigh Rimmel who went along on the last expedition was totally left out? As I sat there wondering why such a Great story was so disfigured, the scene in the native village is shown, Walmart Tiki torches with wicks, lining the way to the river! Really? Maybe today but Not in 1925. I guess what is so maddening is this could have been another Bridge over the River Kwai or Lawrence of Arabia. Instead it's a boring, talky, overly long non-epic destined to be forgotten.",The Lost City of Z 2016.csv

","Though I never gave the TV show enough of a chance (too young to appreciate it at that time I suppose), I quite enjoyed the movie. A funny black comedy with well-defined characters and well-chosen actors to play them. I thought I'd never relate to anyone other than Alan Alda to embody the witty persona of Hawkeye Pierce, but a young Donald Sutherland fit the bill to a tee. Likewise for Robert DuVall as the morally preachy Frank Burns who turns hypocrite when lusting after the equally stuffy 'Hot Lips' Houlihan (a role played to perfection by Sally Kellerman). This was also the first time I recall enjoying Elliott Gould in anything.MASH succeeds as an unconventional twist on the Korean War by concentrating on the insubordinate antics of the men and women caught up in its horrors as workers at a U.S. Medical Unit. While it's effective enough as the dark comedy it is, I think it might have benefited even more by contrasting the quirky humor with occasional sharp doses of biting reality and real-life tragedy. If director Robert Altman tried to do that via the bloody surgical sequences, it doesn't come off quite as strong today.

oneislandphotography,10,3,4,19-Dec-12," Two musicians on the run from the mob don drag and meet sweet Sugar
","Some Like It Hot is a retelling of a West German tale titled Fanfaren der Liebe (1951) (Fanfares of Love) beautifully directed by Billy Wilder with an all-star cast including the eternal beauty of Marilyn Monroe, and comedy styling's of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. With a central prolific theme that has been told more than once and yet is just as prevalent today as it ever was or will be: What we want and what we need are often two separate things. However, under the expertise of Wilder, the pure star quality of cast and crew shine out all the more. The gags come thick and fast with almost every sequence either a set up for the next gag or a gag in the making. Some Like It Hot is a tale that begins with a bitterly cold February in Chicago 1929, which two musicians find themselves on the run from the mob, after witnessing the Saint Valentines Massacre. Our intrepid hero's Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) disguise themselves as female musicians Josephine (Curtis) and Daphne (Lemmon), and join an all-girl orchestra bound for Miami.Leaving behind a bitter Chicago winter, they meet the intoxicating Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe), which Jerry remarks ""Look how she moves. Like Jell-O on springs. She must have some sort of built-in motor. I tell you, it's a whole different sex.""(Jack Lemmon Some Like It Hot 1959) Henceforth comedy ensues with the gags coming thick and fast, lightening reflexes with the dialogue between Joe, Jack and Sugar and perfect comedic timing between them. A testament to all that is womanhood, has yet to be a finer than Marilyn Monroe, seemingly poured into the gowns lovingly crafted by Australian costume designer Orry-Kelly, with neck lines and translucent qualities that would even have the censors of today raising eyebrows. With her classic solo of ""I Wanna Be Loved by You."" Albeit Marilyn does not have the best singing voice, which is superfluous when one considers the situation, a pretty girl standing in front of an orchestra and singing a song. Monroe and Wilder turn it into one of the most blatantly sexual scenes in the movies. Monroe wears a clinging, see-through dress, gauze covering the upper slopes of her breasts, the neckline scooping to a censor's eyebrow north of trouble. Wilder places her in the centre of a round spotlight that does not simply illuminate her from the waist up, but toys with her like a secondary neckline, dipping and clinging as Monroe moves her body higher and lower in the light with teasing precision.All the time Monroe seems oblivious to the effect of singing this song so innocently. To experience that scene is to affirm as to why no other actor since, male or female has more sexual chemistry with the camera.Underneath all the frills, bold sexual symbolism, and gender bending, the movie is ultimately about Joe and Jerry (Curtis and Lemmon) with truly outstanding supporting characters like Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) and Spats Colombo (George Raft). While Joe (Curtis) when not in drag introduces himself as the Shell Oil heir and wickedly parodies Cary Grant's unmistakable accent in brilliant fashion, so much so that when Daphne/Jerry (Lemmon) says accusingly ""And where did you get that phoney accent? Nobody talks like that!"" Jerry (Lemmon) gets the fuzzy end of the lollipop taking the selfless route and entertains a real millionaire whose yacht is being used by Joe (Curtis) in an attempt to seduce Sugar (Monroe). Daphne (Lemmon) is so unlike a real woman in mannerism as much as appearance that when real millionaire Osgood (Joe E. Brown) attempts to wine and dine him, it is hilarious that he cannot see behind Jerry's (Lemmon) disguise. With Osgood seducing Jerry (Lemmon) on the dance floor and Joe (Curtis) seducing Sugar (Monroe) on the yacht is both romantic and wickedly funny at the same time. The payoff happens during the following morning, when Joe returns to their room to find Jerry now engaged to Osgood. Keep an eye Jack Lemmon (Jerry/Daphne) during this scene; he is so energetic, so full of life, almost to the point of hamming it up with his castanets. Jerry/Daphne (Lemmon) is exquisite in this sequence. He is deliriously happy at finding his soul mate. He is so hilariously convincing that even when asked by Joe (Curtis), ""Why would a guy want to marry a guy?"" that we completely buy it when he answers, ""Security!"" Even though the violence in this gem of the silver screen is neither satire nor comedy but visceral and grim, which adds to the overall feel that the Hero's (Joe and Jerry) very lives are in peril and we joyously buy every gag and punch line that Billy Wilder expertly delivers to us. I do not believe I am alone in the opinion that Wilder was one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century. Escaping Europe before World War II, Wilder set about commenting on the world around him with a sensibility and awareness seldom seen in cinema today. Yet he could create a film that, yes has a darker undertone of the mob's ruthlessness, but oh so wonderfully light hearted and romantic characters that once they realized what they wanted wasn't what they needed, and that they needed no pretence to attain what they desired. Simply put Some Like It Hot is one of those timeless classics that are just as relevant and amusing today as it was when it was released. It captured one of those great moments in movie-making, where a film no longer is a simple representative of its period, but has transcended itself to become something that is truly timeless. Osgood (Brown) delivers the best curtain line in the movies. If you have seen the movie, you know what it is, and if you have not, you deserve to hear it for the first time from him.",Some Like It Hot 1959.csv

","Unfortunately Serbian propaganda animated all Serbs to vote and to give negative vote for this movie. Actually thru events shown in the movie are even scarier. Movie shows who is real aggressor in the Bosnian war. SERBIA IS AGGRESSOR, and on top of that still not punished for the crimes committed in Bosnia during 92-95 war. On the Milosevic trial prosecutor office made a deal with Serbia and they denied to present evidence to Bosnian side who sued Serbia for Genocide not only in Srebrenica but in entire Bosnia. Serbian propaganda now days is trying to make all sides equally guilty for the war in Bosnia. I just hope that people will believe more their own eyes and what they saw on CNN, BBC during that time then to Serbian propaganda. Let it be known that there is still Republic of Srpska within Bosnia and Herzegovina, ethnically cleaned from all Bosniaks and Croats. World and Europe tolerate that state of insanity. This is why everyone should see this movie. Movie may be graphic, but the real war is even more graphic, and if no one tells the story how it really was, then people forget. I would ask all, especially westerners to first see the movie and then to vote. I sincerely think that this movie deserves more attention.",In the Land of Blood and Honey 2011.csv

","""If you keep pursuing me, I will bring this fight to your door!!"" I remember that line from the character Jason Bourne, like it was yesterday. This was a tense and taught thriller, with a solid connecting hit!! Wow! From the professional music score that rivets you into your seat and then the clash of action that comes down around you from gun fire to self-defensive technique, that is exacting and bone breaking! Jason, is a trained professional, in everything he does. He is skilled in re-con, he is a tactician, he is a warrior that is trained and molded to win. To make good, wherever he is, and whatever the assignment may be. Until the little child that he saw on the yacht, that one night that he was sent to take out Wombosic he screwed up, and it nearly cost him his life! Now, with Marie traveling with him, things are about to change...again.But now it's changed and he is on the move with a team tracking his moves. Lead by Ward Abbott( Brian Cox) he is starting to feel someone on his path, just behind him, yet he is able to maneuver out of the way, and give himself enough time to set-up camp and wait for their arrival. The best example, being, 'The Professor' he took, him down in the wide open space of a field, with a lot of cover grass. Then, that chase scene, with Jason driving into oncoming traffic, was edgy and a perfect get away! It's his war and he will bring it all out, to them. Matt Damon is on it, all the way.I recommend for people who love a fantastic and enthralling action plot in a film, with a superb cast. (*****)",The Bourne Identity 2002.csv

","I admit this film tries, and it tries rather hard and almost succeeds. everyone says this is inspiring, original and brilliant. i see a slow, relatively boring piece that has been done before. i will admit though, i did like some of the movie. i liked Sharlto Copely as Wikus and considering it was his first film, his performance is nicely done. i liked the CGI, it looked very real, it did actually feel like they were there. but its only the alien father and son (thats quite funny to see) that you feel for. the rest of the aliens just seem like puppets, clicking and growling and making no impact, even in death.and thats a big problem with this film, you are supposed to feel for the race. its basically a take on racism and how you're supposed to feel for the race, but i didn't. not even when it showed the room full of the 'prawn' carcasses that had been experimented on. the music was right, the acting was right, the feeling was not.another thing with this movie, its really jumbled. it starts out like a mockumentary, but then switches to a cinematic style without you even realise it. its like it takes styles from a few different movies and just threw them in, not caring how it went. and need i say about that f*cking singer. you heard her/him in avatar, black hawk down and others and its supposed to make the scene more dramatic, but all i want to do is wrap a bat round that persons f*cking head. and finally, the 3rd act. it doesn't inspire anything, its just taken a leaf out of Michael bays book and gone for action (granted it does look absolutely fantastic) but they could of done so much more. overall, i cant see why this is regarded as one of the greats in sci fi cinema. its a jumbled telling of the Mose's story and i don't really like it. if you want real sci fi, go rent 2001 or Dr Strangelove by Kubrick.",District 9 2009.csv
ItStinks,2,0,0,15-May-03," Grossly Inferior to the Original - Spoiler-Free
","I will divulge none of the actual plot of the sequel but only comment on the overall merits of the film.  Simply put, it is no match for the power and revolutionary storytelling of the first movie.  The original movie had such a groundbreaking concept - the idea that the real world is no more than a computer program.  It then backed it up with a solid plot, a good hero, and a virus program as a villain.  Many of the visuals, I believe, will go down in history like the bicycle scene from E.T. or the horse-head scene in the Godfather:  Trinity doing cartwheels to dodge Uzi fire or Neo bending space and time to dodge bullets on the rooftop.The new movie lacks all of the above.  It has some phenomenal special effects and the groundbreaking technicality of the ""burly fight"" and the highway scene have already been well established.  That said, there is none of the mystery or the ""whoa, my brain hurts"" revelations of the first.  The dialogue at times is downright horrible.  There are whole, extended scenes that do nothing to advance the plot, nor do they even flesh out characters. They exist solely to showcase bad techno music without even some action to temper the tedium.The effects, likewise, while technically brilliant, come too fast, too often so that they have none of the power that they did in the first movie.  There are a few totally new innovations that are very cool and I won't give away. But, by and large, it is more of the same wirefighting techniques.  Quick punches and flips.  Jump, stop camera, rotate, kick butt in slow-mo, then resume action.  It gets very boring, very quickly.Positive notes:  The new character, Link, is a revelation.  He definitely steals the show.  And Hugo Weaving is still a solid villain.  Some really cool cameos too (Roy Jones, Jr.!!)Sadly, it has sapped a lot of the desire to see the third.  I gave it 3/10.",The Matrix Reloaded 2003.csv

","I can't recall seeing such a wide diversity of opinion for a flick in this space, and I can't help thinking that the disagreement probably splits between those who are sympathetic to the military and its traditions, and those who view the military as anathema. I side with the fans of this movie. I found myself thoroughly engrossed, from beginning to end, by a completely plausible story (with one or two weak spots) well acted and told without cheap plot devices. Tommy Lee Jones plays against type here; contrary to his standard screen persona of agressive alpha-male types, here he plays a man plagued by self-doubt and lack of confidence. It is an excellent portrayal. Samuel Jackson acquits himself with honors as well. Also notable are Guy Pearce (an Englishman!) as the prosecutor, Major Biggs, and Dale Dye who makes an awfully convincing Major General Perry (it seems that Dye has an extensive military background himself). As far as the weak spots, there are any number of crowd dispersal techniques - e.g., CS gas - which, in a real confrontation, would be used prior to resorting to live fire. And the little closing tag-lines telling us what happened to the protagonists are indeed a stupid touch in a fictional film, as a previous viewer commented.

eqan-asif,8,1,6,25-May-12," Suffers from my a loose plot, but the major(and minor) actors deliver.
","If I'm allowed to give only one piece of advice to the writers in Hollywood, and for what it's worth, I would say that writers should stay away from time travel. As my proof, I would present to them the MiB 3, a movie that delivered on most accounts but was thoroughly let down because of the loose plot. Time travel has been done well by some movies only because they dwell on it, taking a considerable amount of time to plug the holes and shoring up the loose ends. In this movie, however, time travel is just a convenient plot device another dimension to Agent J and Agent K, both as individuals and as partners. It is especially superfluous when time travel is used as combat strategy in an action sequence. In short, the whole time travel part was thoroughly needless, and flashbacks--or something else--would've done everything the writers intended, but without leaving the more plot holes than a block of Swiss cheese left out in a firing range. If one can suffer me to dwell on the negatives bit longer, I can relate another major problem with the movie: pacing. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, as Agent J and Agent K, have some actual chemistry, and there some moments that really did get profoundly emotional. It is quite plausible, expected even, that J as K's partner for 14 years would deeply suffer from the loss of his partner. The movie, however, expects us to play out at that emotional drama in our head. During the second and the third acts of the movie, there are scenes that keep pulling at our heartstrings by displaying all the tiny things about K that J missed: eating pie, drinking coffee, listening to country music. Here's when the problem with pacing comes in. Agent J has been barely separated from K for 12 yours! Unless J is a hyper-sensitive, emotionally needy man who cannot go without half a day without pining for his partner like a stricken puppy, he cannot possibly miss K that much. I won't lie and say that I wasn't affected by those very scenes, but at the back of mind, I was relishing those very moments if the movie had managed its time better i.e. if there actually had been a separation between the two agents!Now, going on to to things that worked: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, and Josh Brolin (as K of 1969) all deliver solid performances. The comedy derived from that man-love relationship is just what you would expect-- and want. There are is an especially great cameo from Bill Hader as Andy Warhol, and there are are numerous other pop culture references creating a certain temporal irony--even racism is light-heatedly (but effectively) tackled. One might wish that the entire movie was comprised of that, but as Prates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides showed us, a series of loosely connected comedic set pieces cannot alone carry the movie. MiB 3 knows this, which is why the majority of the movie revolves around the relationship between J and K, and there is enough serious pathos that makes the comedic moments memorable. Two characters, the movie's main antagonist, Jemaine Clement as Boris the Animal, and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, a fifth dimension being who can perceive an infinite number of realities simultaneously, are two characters that add little to nothing from the movie. They don't necessarily hurt the movie, but if their characters were tweaked a bit-- or in Griffin's case, not added at all--would've have movie all the much better. Boris is an archetypal villain. He is without any remorse or compassion, he carries out assassinations ruthlessly (although he is quite incompetent when it comes to killing an MiB agents), and has a burning desire for vengeance. For all his faults, there aren't any redeemable qualities that emotionally manipulate us at his eventual downfall, but he isn't also quite evil enough that we wish his death with a passion. He's sort of there simply to move the story forward. Most of time he assassinates aliens off-screen, and forgive me for this, but it's hard to sympathize with aliens. A slightly evil Boris, or a slightly less evil Boris would've been better than the cookie cutter Boris that we have in the movie.Any amount of time that Griffin gets on screen is an absolute waste of time. I know it's hard not to deliver some philosophical perspective when the very secrets of the entire universe are at stake, but pseudo- philosophical perspective delivered by Griffin is very much bland and unimaginative. In the hopes of appearing existential, Griffin spouts a lot of nonsense that you just have take on its face value because there is nothing deeper within. a) When there is an inter-dimensional being who alone has the key to stopping a genocidal race of aliens, why wouldn't it use it on his own plant? b) Why is the physical presence of a ""fifth dimensional"" being is so important, and why can it be hurt physically when the creature is metaphysical? c) It could very well be irony, but why is the favorite moment in human history of this preternatural being a goddamn baseball game? No matter how much the movie tries to explain this last point, a baseball game--or any sporting event for that matter--seems for too trivial in about 7,000 years of human civilization.For all the faults that I've mentioned, I gave the movie a score of 8. I chose to dwell on the things that didn't work because there was an agonizing amount of potential in this movie that was all wasted. There was a lot of thought that went into the movie to create the relationship between J and K, the main plot, however, could have been procedurally generated by an algorithm: cookie-cutter villain, convenient plot device, and some pseudo-philosophy to make the movie look deep.",Men in Black 3 2012.csv

However, i must echo many other reviewers sentiments in that you can't help coming away from the film feeling a little disappointed. It was an opportunity missed, a chance at greatness squandered. The first half of the film is great, and the sense of a potential epic builds within the first 45 mins. From there onwards unfortunately, the film dips in story and credibility and never really recovers. It doesn't turn into a bad film, but simply fails to take advantage of the initial momentum. Too many holes in the plot become badly exposed. Why was getting the tube from the lab so easy? Why weren't the aliens using their own weapons against the humans?

Frankie himself has a lot of tragedies in his life, that of being an unsuccessful husband and father..... He considers himself at fault at losing his friend and colleague, Morgan Freeman's right eye.....But he is the best trainer around, and he doesn't train girls, especially not over aged girls..... But when his fighter dumps him, things take a turn and soon we find him at the corner of Maggie Fritgerald, the Mo Cuishle.....Maggie wins matches, mostly through knockouts, becomes famous and buys herself out of poverty but her own family, a bitch of a mother and assholes of siblings look at her as a money pond....She gets a shot at the title, and she has control of the match when the champ, does a dirty trick on her causing her a spinal cord fracture....This leads to the end of her career, as she is stuck to her bed, eventually her legs had to be amputated due to infection, and she is left crippled, for life.....But the ""Mo Cuishle"" is a born fighter and she convinces her 'Boss' to kill her and instead of letting her live this pathetic life.... Her death drives away Frankie fro m the regular training job and he reclines himself to a street side diner eating lemon pies.....The entire story of the movie is superb and though the dialog is slightly weak in nature the acting qualities overshadows it pretty easily.... The sound effects are outstanding and so is the cinematography.... The music is also very soothing to the ear.... The camera work is amazing, especially during the fights.....A special mention has to be made for Hilary Swank, for an outstanding performance.... She really took the movie into another level... Morgtan Freeman was also very impressive, in his part as the ex-boxer and the caretaker of the Gym..... Clint Eastwood looked slightly overshadowed by these two, and it is probably because of the lack of strong dialogs...

","I am not one to usually write reviews, but I had to on this movie. Book adaptations scare me, as most directors and writers are not quite able to capture the spirit the book held. I think that is why this movie is something different to me.First off, this is not a movie that requires a lot of back story, you are taking a journey with the characters, and you develop bonds with them feeling like you are there watching over their shoulder, almost as a character yourself.The acting... the acting is above reproach. Not going to give anything away, but I can't find a single actor who did a sub-par performance. Marcia Gay Harden and Sam Witwer are two actors whose performances truly stood out to me, and of course you have the Walking Dead's Laurie Holden, Melissa McBride and Jeffery DeMunn working side by side with the Punisher's Thomas Jane.And, of course, without revealing anything, the ending. The infamous ending. I love the ending in how it compliments the feeling of the story, but I can't watch it. It is so well done, and so wonderful in how it brings a finality to the story, but I always stop the movie right before.

As one who never really enjoyed Star Trek, I found myself pleasantly surprised with how likable this movie was.The casting itself is one of the great pluses to begin with, especially with Zachary Quinto who manages to make being Spock look so easy. Simon Pegg delivers very well as Scotty with funny moments, but not being too over the top - good job there. And Anton Yelchin definitely steals the show in any of his scenes as Chekov.Kirk was well-casted too, but the others definitely warranted a greater mention.The greatest thing about this movie was that it managed to be genuinely funny, without compromising itself. There are so many brief moments and quick gags that work with snap precision. The worst things I can say about this film was the somewhat weak plot and the superficial character development (understandable, given how many characters were shoved at us). But everything else was awesome enough to divert focus from the minuses.If you've never seen anything Trek, or maybe saw one or two episodes - you will like this.

","There should have been a good story here but the main problem is that it offered nothing new that the audience didn't already know. I wasn't personally directly effected by the crash, as I don't own a mortgage, that being said it effected everything else such as the economy after the bailouts so effected me in that way. In some way it was interesting to see a different perspective on the causes of the crash and see it all play out.Another issues is that this movie is too complicated to understand for a layman, and the movie admits this itself by having those 2-3 minute moments when they get celebs like Margot Robbie trying to explain something while taking a bath, I mean come on that was just stupid. If a movie is that complicated, don't make it as the audience will become disinterested and less enjoyable.Hollywood should never really complicate a story as it will capture a larger audience. One of the reasons I love the Other Guys with Will Farrell and Mark Walberg is that they covered the Wall Street Crash but made it simple to understand.Yet I will say that some of the actors were excellent and I am starting to see the next Tom Hanks in Steve Carell, moving from comedy to drama.

","If you like rough, rowdy, tough and raw...this one you will probably like. Quentin Tarantino's eight movie is not exactly his best; but it is far from being bad. Some can be disappointed, but THE HATEFUL EIGHT has no problem pleasing those looking for the expected bloody violence.The Civil War has ended and a stagecoach hurtles through snowy Wyoming (filmed in Colorado) as infamous bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) takes his prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), to Red Rock in the name of justice. Savage blizzard conditions will end up having a gathering of conflicting characters holding up a way station. Vengeful Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a notorious bounty hunter to his own acclaim; Oswald Mobray (Tim Roth), the hang man in Red Rock; Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins), the new sheriff of Red Rock; General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) and journal writing cowpoke, Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) and Mexican Bob (Demian Bichir) are hunker-downed in the old drafty haberdashery known as Minnie's.Paranoria, mistrust and grandiose tales turn the movie into an over talkative, violent free-for-all. Tarantino narrates this film that plays out in chapters as an over-the-top brutal and vulgar stage play. There is so much detail in filling out the characters and the look of the film itself is as beautiful as it is rustic.

evertonman75,9,1,4,05-Jul-13," There's something about it. It's hard to explain!
","Yes I guess it is a little late in the day to be adding my take on this cinematic venture. I have enjoyed 'Drive' several times throughout the last 2 years and have decided belatedly to write my findings for you equally sceptical, over analytical cynicists out there. Unashamedly I initially expected a film about a dubious hero who can drive good and gets into some serious excrement that he has to try and find a way out of. I am straight, so the prospect of Goslings semi naked anatomy was neither here nor there to me. However, there appeared to be a romantic element in the DVD synopsis, It was getting late, I wanted to get drunk and decided it may be a good mix of action/ romance that the wife would pay attention to and divert her icey scrutiny away from yours truly for a few hours. I knew Bryan Cranston held a key role (much admired) so I drank lots and braced myself for the lovey-dovey-weepy-sniffy-yawny-snory abomination that some of IMDb's original reviewers had led me to believe beforehand....I am not going to dwell on scene after scene nor will I be spoiling the plot but the opening of this movie was attention grabbing. Gosling picks up his kit and exits the motel room, mission in mind, and then something really unexpected happened...Electropop dynamic Kavinsky's 'Nightcall' kicks-in with 80's hot-pink titles and from there the movie was fascinating, carving out a niche genre of film making which surprised the hell out of me.If your going to simplify most movies as previous reviewers have then you can probably sum the plot and storyline of most movies up in a few well-considered words and I suppose 'Drive' is no exception. However, what is the exception are the patient moments where nothing much is happening but at the same time you are a slave to the screen and captivated with both beautiful & atmospheric intensity coupled with a soundtrack which would never usually tickle my tastebuds but added a sublime haunt during some scenes,keeping me transfixed throughout.I consider to be a wonderful story of love, benevolence and obscurity. I suppose much like this review.I have not seen a film like this since and that dear readers is the most surprising thing - unusually i'm not glad.",Drive 2011.csv
antj999,10,2,6,27-Jul-07," Simpsons Movie does NOT disappoint!
","Personally I do not really think that the Simpsons has been going downhill in recent years, though I can accept points of views stating that it has. With many people discussing the decline in quality of the show over the past few years I even had my doubts as to how good (or more to the point, how great) the movie would actually be.It did not disappoint...far from it in fact. It by far exceeded my expectations, and my expectations were almost unreachable!! From the opening scene to the closing scene this film delivers what every Simpsons fan wants and what every Simpsons episode should deliver. With so many moments that will have you laughing for an assortment of reasons, this movie is an example of why the Simpsons has lasted so long, and could last for much longer! The film is suitable for all the family, with the little children having their own moments to laugh at, whilst not understanding some of the more adult jokes. There are a few moments/scenes which the show would not include in a TV-aired episode. These moments come as sometimes a shock but are ALL hilarious! The Simpsons Movie, whilst being side-splittingly funny from start to end, also has probably one of the most emotional scenes ever seen from our favourite yellow family.Homer's imagination, stupidity and golden heart are the essence of this amazingly beautifully crafted and hilarious film.Whether you are a Simpsons fan of years gone by, a current fan or someone who wants to know 'what the big deal' is - I highly recommend this movie! You will not be disappointed! My only possible criticism is that I would have liked it to be longer...but surely that is a compliment more than a criticism? 10/10",The Simpsons Movie 2007.csv
sljohnson12,1,6,9,22-Dec-12," Terrible
","Production Values do not make a film, as this facet is a given in high budget movies. Adequate Actors do not make a film excellent if the script is poor - in this case mediocre - and there is a complete lack of characterization. A Screenplay with an interesting premise does not make a good film if the development is good but becomes extremely drawn out, then suddenly a rushed ending is thrown at the audience. The cliffhanger is great, though.Allusions to stand alone classics and mythology do not make a film if they do little to nothing in contribution to the film in its entirety. People have lauded this film as if it is some avant-garde, incredible work of art for in the least its name being a reference to the Greek myth where Man is made, given the ability to make fire, as well as metaphysical overtones inherent of such, and the obvious reference to the story of the birth of Christ. All of this does little to actually help the film. If anything, these allusions are made to make the film seem deeper than it is.Again, the premise is the best part, and while I was enjoying it so much as I am a huge fan of science fiction, there came a time in the film when I was struggling to come up with warrants to justify why the film was good, let alone why I should not walk out. I am capable to logic and reasoning- people complain at how analytical I am at times - yet, hopefully not to sound cyclical, it was when the film started to drag on that I, in retrospect, should have walked out.I have never walked out on a film before (except for the second installment of Lord of the Rings, due to the fact I couldn't stand the directing). At least I got to watch that movie for free. I regret having spent $9 to see this movie. It had some good scenes though and I know not to watch this as if it is an Alien film, but treat it more like a separate sci fi film (given the ending, it is impossible to - I will say no more).

","Steven Spielberg is my favorite film Director. He has brought to the screen some of the most spectacular films the world has ever seen. E.T., Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Poltergeist are among my top ten list but Spielberg's record is extensive; Duel, Close Encounters, Jaws, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, A.I., Minority Report, even some more recent ones like War Horse and Tin Tin held their place among a high caliber. I always regarded Poltergeist as a groundbreaking powerhouse that is perfectly crafted from the very opening television sequence to the final rolling credits with the ghosts laughing in the background; and Heather O'Rourke was an unforgettable angel.I'm saying all this because, I have to be honest, this version of War Of The Worlds seems to lack most of the signature Spielberg qualities in a rather blatantly large fashion. What I mean is everything is grand in scale yet there is literally NO substance. Which is for me, shocking, considering Spielberg's talent and his perfectionist drive. Even someone who isn't a regular moviegoer would roll their eyes at this mess.Tom Cruise is unconvincing as a dock worker. Dakota Fanning is a wonderful actress but having her scream like a brat was unnecessary. The kid and daddy didn't get along, so..... Tom Cruise attempts to make peanut butter sandwiches because they'll need food on the road except he forgot that his daughter is allergic?!

","First of all I must say I didn't read the book (reading is not one of my favourite hobbies), so I wasn't one of those who went see the movie knowing already the entire story. For me it was all new! The movie wasn't really as I expected, because I thought it would be a lot more around a ""theological discussion"" and not this ""religious thriller"". Even so, the plot is interesting and has great suspense until the end of the movie, when all ""mysteries"" are reveledÂ… Now talking a little more about the Dan Brown's masterpiece itself, ""The Da Vinci Code"", I think what really matters there is that he's trying to change something in history, especially in our Christian societies. We all used to see the Christianity through the point of view of some untouched dogmas. There are some ""truths"" from we can't even have the littlest doubt, because they are just like that, and they will be this way foreverÂ…We cannot change it, because it's sacred, it would be a Heresy! It's called a Dogma, and the Catholic Church has plenty of them. But the Dan Brown's novel tries to change some of these Dogmas, transforming some details of the life of this myth called Jesus Christ. And if he was a human being, with wife and kids, like all of us? Would it change the faith of people? Would people disbelieve Christ's words just because some Dogmas about his life were changed? I don't think so, but the Vatican doesn't have the same opinionÂ…One thing is for sure, ""Son of God"" or ""just human"", Jesus Christ is one of the most important personalities of all Mankind's history. His life changed many things, and it's still being important to many people; so, either we like it or not, Jesus Christ's life will still be discussed, theorized and even ""invented"" (in some details) for many years, as it has been so far!",The Da Vinci Code 2006.csv

TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7,1,2,21-Aug-04," Well, what'd you expect?
","I'm baffled at why people have high expectations for movies based on video games. No matter how good the source material is, you can't expect a video game to do good as a movie. I imagine that's where a lot of heat towards this movie is coming from; hordes of Resident Evil game fans who hate the film because it has got very little to do with the games. I agree, it doesn't have a lot to do with the games; there are a few references to various of the video game titles, and there are the zombies, and it does try to build the atmosphere of the games. But it just doesn't work too good in the end. The film is billed as an action/thriller/science fiction/horror film; unfortunately, not too many of those aspects of the film work very good. The action is pretty good, but action sequences are few and far between. The thriller parts are decent enough; I really enjoyed the very last scene. The science fiction portions of the film are not very well thought out or particularly professionally executed; I kind of liked the basic idea of the film, but it just didn't seem to work too well. The horror consists of director Paul W.S. Anderson's personal brand of loud noise, sudden scares/shocks(or attempts at such) and intense rock music. It does have some good scares, and some of the zombie scenes are quite intense. But a big problem with the zombies is the fact that they don't even turn up in the movie for a solid 45 minutes. That's almost half of the film. And there passes many scenes that don't involve any zombies at all. I suppose the film was supposed to be tense during those scenes, as in, the tension of knowing that the zombies are out there, but I was never really afraid of them. The plot is nonsensical and pretty badly put together. The acting is decent, but not at all great. The character development is nearly non-existent. The special effects are great; well, mostly great. There are a few times where the CGI is obvious, and quite a few where it's badly used. Worth noting is the amount of details that are taken from various of the games. Something that annoyed me was the lack of realism in the film; these zombies/walking corpses are supposed to be a few hours old, right? Then how come their teeth are so decayed, half of their faces rotten, and various of their body parts so screwed up? I know it was done for effect, but it was fairly ridiculous. Also, the action and stunts that Milla Jovovich's character pull off is not the least bit realistic, and mainly looks like a direct rip-off of The Matrix. All in all, I suppose it's decent enough. For such a just-above-average-film, I'm surprised at how many times I've managed to sit through it. Maybe that explains my rating. Who knows. I recommend it to fans of the various aforementioned genres. Just watch it with low expectations, and don't try too hard to make sense of the plot. 7/10",Resident Evil 2002.csv

","This is a poor film.I was given free tickets to a preview of this film and I have to report that I have never seen as many people walk out of a film as I did with Walter Mitty.The plot is predictable and clichÃƒÂ©d, relying too heavily on what is supposed to be a feel good factor (it isn't) and the quirky qualities of its lead characters (they aren't).Just to make it clear, this film isn't quirky, it's irritating, tedious and deeply frustrating. There are several problems with the film not least the central premise of the plot. For those of you who are unaware the Ben Stiller character regularly drifts off into flights of fantasy where he imagines he is a super hero, or an alpine ski God, or Benjamin Button and here is where the movie really loses its way. The 'dream' sequences are misjudged and out of place. They add nothing to the plot and actually take you away from the narrative of the main story. As a result when he drifts off it becomes increasingly frustrating as you just want the story to progress without the constant (and irritating) disruptions. As a result the story is unevenly paced, and you lose all sympathy for the lead character.While I am usually a big fan of Ben Stiller, he was miss cast as the nerdy office worker who is transformed into the would be hero in this misfiring story. His performance is wooden and he is not helped by a corny script, and the decision by the director to surround Walter Mitty with a series of parodies of office workers (the shy beautiful girl, the ball busting out of touch boss, the put upon overweight co-worker etc).The film seems confused as to who is its audience, and as a result it falls between several stools.

There is meant to be a novelty in watching all of these legendary action heroes team up on screen. However, I never really felt like the film pulled this off. For starters, some actors have very little screen time, including Rourke and Willis. Other actors also were very sidelined, and I never felt like the team dynamic was really there. I wasn't convinced at all that the characters had been friends for years, despite the film's pretense of such.In general, the movie is incredibly cliched, without actually being entertaining. The mission, the heroes, the villains, the romance, all of it. It's very empty.The action is fine, I guess. It's there.

The cinematography is electrifying, every shot is beautiful and the score holds brilliance, it carries a very obvious John Carpenter vibe to it. The tension is raw, avoiding cheap jump scares and relies on music. Its eerie atmosphere is extremely effective keeping you inches above your seat for the majority of the runtime. The characters are interesting, providing depth and emotional attachment, most modern horror films seem to forget the importance of character development, its nice to see the genre hasn't completely lost it yet. There are several jumps scares, but they work, as they are not carried with unnecessary piecing music jolts but with the use of disturbing and sudden imagery.The only errors I could detect were the unconventional editing style, the transitions were a little dodgy lacking fluency, this left the film to appear choppy at times but this flaw can be easily forgiven. Its outstanding cinematography and soundtrack make up for this. The film leaves a daunting stain of disturbing after effects that follow you for a long while, with a constant reminder to always check behind your back.

Is it completely scientifically accurate.....who cares? General moans include:1.Matt Damon isn't funny. Well he seems to be doing alright for himself as an unfunny actor. I find him very entertaining and I thought his performance was good and, even if I hadn't I'd like to think I would have stopped short of lambasting him.2.'It's unrealistic'...'It would never happen'...'That's not right' blah, blah, blah. As I said earlier...who care's? It's a film not a documentary. The fact that basement dwellers are up in arms because we don't actually have to sit and wait the 25 mins that it would take for any communication to get to and from is laughable. I'm glad we didn't have to 'wait it out'. 'He's a Botanist....what's he doing there'? Well...and I'm no expert but perhaps, given that NASA have sent a Mission to Mars...potentially with a view to 'one day colonizing said Planet' a botanist might be handy?

God forbid that any future mission to Mars uses this film as a training guide because there's no mention at all of 'bacteria...ph levels...lighting levels'..zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...Good! Couldn't be happier that all that mumbo jumbo was left out. 3. 'There's no sense of actual loneliness'.....Maybe it should have been a hour and a half of Matt Damon weeping into the cameras? Sounds fun....cut to Matt kicking the dirt in boredom....now we're talking, much more entertaining. 4. 'The special effects aren't up to scratch'.....yawn, next! 5. 'It's not a true portrayal of human nature'....It seems that because the characters were actually nice to each other and didn't spend their time insulting each other it means it's a poor film.....Here's an idea..lighten up a bit, have some fun.

So, needless to say my expectations were not very high when I went to see this with some friends tonight.The film surpassed my expectations, as the show usually does. The characterization is consistent with the series and the Addams family of the '90s is just as lovably screwed up as they have always been.The central problem this time is that, partly due to Homer's behavior, the levels of pollution in Springfield are so high that the EPA quarantines the entire town. A lynch mob goes after the family, but they escape to Alaska to start a new life. The plot set-up is also cleverly connected to religious superstitions and mass-paranoia. This takes us about half an hour or maybe a little further into the film.There are plenty of relatively smart jokes (compared to the average Will Ferrell flick), with some satirical political overtones, and a bit of risquÃ© humor as well.I recommend The Simpsons Movie to fans of the show, and friends of fans.

And that alone earned it some extra stars in my eyes.As time has gone by, I've begun to realize that I have to re-examine Ryan Gosling. He's not an actor I want to like, and I'm not enamored with several of the films he's selected, but every time I've watched one of his films, I've been impressed. And as much here, as anywhere.I was also not very familiar with Rachel McAdams...but wow! She's tremendous as the young seventeen year old girl!

That was distracting.I have never seen Gena Rowlands (as the old lady) more beautiful and poignant. Joan Allen is, in my view, a much underrated actress, and I wish we saw much more of her. More and more I see James Marsden as a dependable ""sleeper"" of an actor whom I respect.

An hour movie! That's all this needed to be. Who's going to go to the theater and watch an hour long movie back in 2009? So let's just add an hour of filler, thirty minutes of commentary in the beginning, and we'll stretch out the other half hour into long drawn out action sequences towards the end.

The story is so paper thin, that if I told you what it was about, I would pretty much be telling you the whole damned movie.

Times have changed, and now the aliens are no longer welcome, and the military wants to take District 9 back. These aliens are actually pretty peaceful. That is, until you piss them off, and then they are quite ruthless. One of the guys can actually speak and understand the alien language, you know, because there's nothing you can't pull past an audience these days. If they're stupid enough to give this a 10 star review, then they'll be dumb enough to believe a man can speak the extraterrestrial tongue. In the meantime, his hand is developing like an aliens, because if he can speak the language, he may as well be just like them right? He's told it can take up to three years to develop a human hand back. Too bad a story cant be developed here.

","Drive is representative of an entire subset of movie that has wormed its way into popularity among film buffs. A harbinger really. I've taken to calling it the ""Instagram Filter Film"". Exercises in the style where ""style"" is defined as a neon, washed out, out of focus Instagram filter over bland handheld camera work. The Instagram Filter Film also comes with dreary, meditative, vacuous electronic music and performances so subtle, so bereft of emotive risk, that the characters barely even speak at all. The Instagram Filter Film is king. Moonlight, Waves, Under the Skin, and countless other A24 darlings are routinely praised as masterpieces. Online, people frequently cite these films as their ALL-TIME favorite movies. I am baffled, downright perplexed by this sentiment.Why do people love Drive? It cannot be for the story, which follows Ryan Gosling as a stunt/getaway driver through the seedy L.A. crime scene in a series of drawn-out, boring jobs and stilted-beyond-comprehension conversations. The forward momentum of Drive's plot is broken beyond repair. Dialogue is delivered in long, slow, mumbly fragments. Characters are constantly pausing, staring, freezing in place for seconds at a time. It's a massive directorial failure, stabbing the movie in the jugular and watching the lifeblood pour out. This movie dares you not to fall asleep. People have the audacity to call this thing a thriller. I've seen more thrills in line at the DMV. There are some good actors here, but with the possible exception of Albert Brooks, they are zombies. Ryan Gosling is as bad as he's ever been. I have rarely seen a movie star of his caliber deliver as lazy a performance as this. He fights back against any semblance of human emotion. He's so hung up on being cool, that he forgets the part about acting like an actual human being. I think if director Nicolas Winding Refn had his way, he would have hired a wax statue of James Dean instead. That might have been an improvement.No, people love Drive, apparently, for its style. Because Drive is ""cool"" and it looks ""cool"", and it sounds ""cool"" and the costumes are ""cool"". But is it? Refn is clearly obsessed with the superficial elements, at the expense of everything else. And that would be one thing if the superficial elements were interesting. They are not. The music is not my thing. Whatever, I won't hold that against it. But the look. I simply refuse to believe that a human person can prefer the look of Drive to ANYTHING. Pick any movie ever shot on honest-to-God celluloid and it looks clearly, obviously more pleasing to the eye than this dank, murky digital vomit. Seriously, think of the first movie that pops into your head... Good Will Hunting, Lawrence of Arabia, The Cider House flippin' Rules, all infinitely brighter, clearer, more colorful and alive. The mood of Drive is so turgid and mucky and off, I was repulsed by it.Now the real dilemma I have is that so many intelligent people had the direct opposite reaction. People LOVE this movie. They love the look, the mood, the stillness. It's at times like these when I feel like a Martian. I have no idea what people see in this movie, the same way I have no idea what people hear in mumble rap or taste in kale. Someone telling me they prefer Drive to thousands of other movies is like someone telling me they prefer their food rotten. It's literally unbelievable.

mdommer,10,1,2,24-Jul-01," A crystalline, organically conceived film that depicts the unlikely and intolerant balance between nature, war and man .
","In ""The Thin Red Line"" director Terrence Mallick has chosen a well-known war novel by James Jones and given us a brilliant vision that combines the interaction of war and nature along with the thoughts and actions of man in a crystalline organic drama. This may sound verbose but much in the way Frank Lloyd Wright created his ""organic architecture"", a confluence of the site, native building materials and utilitarian form and structure that defined the style, Mallick has graced his audience with an amoebic creation containing the unlikely and intolerant elements of nature, war and man.Much of the criticism of the film's content and style seems to stem from the opinion that war movies must be realistic, faithful to historic review and in this case, loyal to the writings of the author of ""The Thin Red Line"", James Jones. Mallick is an artist of film-making and if this is the form we seeking to understand, it would appear that he has triumphed beyond the highest zenith of this time-honored genre.By contrasting the natural cinematic beauty of the landscape and people of Guadalcanal against the hellish realism of war, Mallick has successfully fused the emotions of, about and between men caught in this impossible situation with the use of narrative voice-overs, a technique he previously mastered in his two other films, ""Badlands"" and ""Days of Heaven"". With the main characters thoughts being shared and shaped gradually throughout the film, the actors and the audience experience the growth of emotions simultaneously. This can be viewed by skeptics as manipulative or it can be viewed as powerfully soulful and heartfelt while building magnificent character studies that transcend war itself. This is the risk and daring that sets Mallick apart from his more popular counterpart, Steven Spielberg and his sentimental saga, ""Saving Private Ryan"".The viewer must either jump aboard for this thrilling, gut-wrenching ride of insightful fulfillment or emotionally abandon ship in favor of the memory of logically safe and realistic dramas that are recognized as the hallmarks of our treasured war film library. I would suggest that most viewers seem to take the easy way out and reject Mallick's art as frivolous and ill-conceived. I would, however, recommend that you whole-heartedly sign on without turning back to experience Mallick's tour of brilliance. It's the only way to discover the true greatness of this war film and to be able to possibly consider it as one of the finest films ever made.",The Thin Red Line 1998.csv

michaelRokeefe,8,1,3,08-Oct-04," Dreams are wishes and hopes...but football is life.
","Very good movie. Based on the book by H.G. Bissinger, Friday NIGHT LIGHTS tells the story of the 1988 season of the Odessa Permian Panthers. It would be almost pointless to argue against the fact that Odessa Texas is one of the hottest hotbeds of High School football. This movie deals with the fact that the Panthers year after year carry the hopes and dreams of the Odessa townsfolk on their shoulders. And the meetings with Midland Lee High School is like a world war fought in the middle of the former oil laden west Texas. The movie strays from the novel, but it is still a thrilling movie following the MOJO Panthers to the state championship game. Billy Bob Thornton is outstanding as the legendary Odessa coach Gary Gaines. The spotlighted players are Boobie Miles(Derek Luke), Don Billingsley(Garrett Hedlund), Chris Comer(Lee Thompson Young), Brian Chavez(Jay Henderson) and Quarterback Mike Winchell played by Lucas Black, who also worked in Billy Bob's SLING BLADE(1996). Country singer Tim McGraw is very believable as a former Panther not pleased with his son's play on the current team. The lives of coaches, parents, boosters, players and 20,000 fans stuffed into Ratliff Stadium rise and fall with what takes place under the Friday night lights. Filming took place in Odessa, Houston and Austin. Actual footage of the 2003 Permian Panthers season is interspersed into this movie that offers some very hard hitting, bone bruising, snot knocking action.

","I did not think much of Kramer's previous courtroom drama, ""Inherit the Wind"" which also starred Spencer Tracy. But the mere premise and ensemble starcast of ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" was reason enough to rent this film and give it a shot.Inspired by true events, this fictionalized account of the trials stars Spencer Tracy as Judge Dan Haywood who is supposed to give judgement in the trial of four Nazi judges who have been charged with crimes against humanity. They have been accused of twisting the law during the Nazi regime and helping the government to put away some socially undesirable individuals and also advocating and permitting the forceful sexual sterilization of some others. One of these judges is Ernst Janning, played by a sad-faced and silent Burt Lancaster, who has once been a much respected figure in the ministry of justice. Books published by him, still being used in some universities, Judge Haywood is baffled about how a man who values justice so much, can be responsible for such heinous acts of brutality.What follows is a gripping courtroom battle of wits between the prosecuting attorney, Col. Lawson (Richard Widmark) and Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell). Amidst all this courtroom chaos, Judge Haywood himself has some experiences of his own, when he is not sitting on the judge's chair, getting acquainted with German people who have lived to see the ghastly past of the Nazi regime, yet seem to be completely oblivious to most of the details, including the holocaust.Stanley Kramer does a great job of directing this film written by Abby Mann. Ernst Gold's original music nicely complements some other German traditional music used in this film, particularly the group singing in bars.The performances: Great..all of them. Special mention, though, about: Spencer Tracy: Excellent as Judge Haywood who is clearly taken aback on how some of the ""good"" Germans he has come to be acquainted with in his short stay can claim to not have any knowledge about the war crimes and holocaust in the Nazi regime.Burt Lancaster: Wonderful portrayal of the sad-eyed Dr. Ernst Janning full of regret for the acts he has been accused of committing.Marlene Dietrich: Great as the widow of a German soldier who was executed.Maximilian Schell: The most scene-stealing performance of them all. He gets some of the most powerful scenes to chew on and pulls it off brilliantly! Last but not the least, the ""single-scene stealers"" as I call them, these actors took my breath away in their very brief appearances: Judy Garland as Irene Hoffman and Montgomery Clift as Rudolf Petersen. Splendid performances, both of them! Academy Award nominations, well-deserved.This film runs more than three hours long, and may require some patience on part of the viewer for all the verbose courtroom proceedings. But once the ""Exit music"" starts playing, you know that you have just had the pleasure of viewing one of the most powerful courtroom films out there. This is also one of those films that will ensure that you have as much the same dilemma, about who to root for, as faced by some principal characters in this film!

asda-man,5,0,2,15-Sep-11," Took a nose dive like the plane
","""United 93"" was not as great as it could and should've been. It had several problems which most people would call weaknesses but also some strengths that make it worth watching. One of the weaknesses in my eyes was the extremely hand-held documentary feel of the film. Shaky cam is great now and again but when it starts to consume the whole film with no control what so ever it starts to become tiresome. Supposedly it was supposed to show the whole panic and lack of control of the whole situation but it needed to be much more controlled like in ""Black Swan"" or ""The Wrestler"".Another weak point was the way the first three quarters were so slow. We don't really care or understand about these plane dots that keep disappearing and several calls from planes saying that they've been hijacked. It became very repetitive and the plane that the whole film is about (93, my age) became over-shadowed until the final scenes. In my opinion the film would've been stronger if it was focused almost completely on 93 being hijacked.I also didn't like the lack of plot. Some may argue that the plot simply was about the 9/11 attacks which is fine, but there were no real characters who we could care about. There seemed to be very little characterisation going on which means the story stalled and couldn't get passed a certain road block. A story could've perhaps been made up, maybe not to the extent of ""Titanc"" but it might've been better if it focused on one or two particular people or families so that the plot could be driven forward a bit more.But, if we put aside all my perhaps unreasonable comments, they're are some good aspects about the film. It did feel realistic which is a sort of must in a real-life account type film. It felt like you could imagine this happening which was good. It was also good how they used unknown actors as this added also to the realism of it all. The final 20 minutes or so are also really good, when the plane actually gets hijacked and the passengers fight back it's thrilling and intense and it should've been like this throughout instead of focussing on the traffic-control peeps.""United 93"" is worth seeing if you get passed the slow beginning. It's final act is what the film is about with great and inspiring actions by the passengers. It's ending is also really good and truthful. Perhaps, if you remember the 9/11 attacks you might appreciate it more, but I was a mere nipper.",United 93 2006.csv

poweller,9,1,2,04-Apr-10," Genuinely Terrifying!
","Consider for a second some of the incredible films Alfred Hitchcock has directed; Rear Window, Psycho, Vertigo to name just a few. It is therefore saying something that in my opinion 'The Birds' is the directors greatest accomplishment.The film, based in California, focuses on a mass outbreak of bird attacks against the residents of Bodega Bay with its main characters the macho Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and a rich 'it girl' of the time, Melanie Daneils (Tippi Hedren). Its perhaps fair to say that if you aren't a fan of leaving questions unanswered in a film this may not be for you. We are never presented with any answers as to just why these birds are choosing to seemingly wage war with humanity, yet in a way this is what makes the film so haunting.As a fan of the horror genre too many films tend to fall in to the trap of displaying frequent over the top gore as a way of providing the shock factor. Whilst 'The Birds' does provide genuine gore, in one scene Brenner's mother travels to a friends farmhouse to find the birds have laid siege to the house and pecked the mans eyes clean out, it is the eerie silences when the birds are gathering and the excellent POV shots that help build suspense, meaning when the shocks do come they are genuinely terrifying!Indeed when Melanie is waiting outside the school and the birds are gathering in silence on the climbing friend behind or when she climbs up to the attic with nothing but torch light.Another thing modern day horror tends to fall into the trap of his underestimating the sheer terror of pure silence. There is no music in 'The Birds' meaning when they do attack all we hear is the shrill sound of the bird calls and the flapping of their wings. Believe me, its a haunting sound! You also cannot underestimate the role the characters play in this film, they are real people who you genuinely care what happens to them. Taylor and Hedren are both excellent but it is arguably Mitch's mother, Jessica Tandy who is the cream of the crop as a character petrified of being left alone. Note her haunting reactions as the camera provides to sudden close up shots after she discovers her friends eyes have been picked out! It may be some 47 years since the release of 'The Birds' yet you would have a very tough time to find many films that can be as genuinely haunting. It is a Hitchcock must see!",The Birds 1963.csv

In doing this he meets a few obstacles such as a bad relationship with another actor and some unfavourable newspaper critiques. And personally he has got a conflict with his daughter. All this is rather ordinary in human terms. Besides that he seems to confuse himself with Birdman his former character that has made him famous, hearing and listening to his voice.

","Like many others I had great expectations of the second Matrix movie. The first movie excelled on many levels. Propelled by an amazing storyline and helped by some of the most ingenious filmmaking I had ever seen The Matrix is one of my all-time favourites. Knowing that everyone working on the first movie would be present for this installment, including the brothers, my hopes were up.***SPOILERS ALERTBut during the first 20 minutes of the movie a nagging feeling crept up on me. The scenes seemed to lack the urgency and style of the first movie and looked more like an extended videoclip. Scenes with people dancing in Zion and Trinity and Neo finally sharing a bed together did not seem to work at all and even annoyed me. It did not get better for the next 20 minutes. The audience was introduced to council-members, commanders and other shipcaptains that were not only uninteresting but ultimately totally irrelevant for the movie. it seemed like 'Phantom Menace' all over again with 20 minutes or so of politics and dialogue. The next part of the movie got a little bit better on the search for 'The Keymaker'. But this part was drawn out far too long, including long and boring dialogue from a hardly introduced character and a feeling of 'this can't be the main pot can it?'.Next a spectacular freeway scene followed that excelled in style and special effects. No complaints here...But then the end of the movie was set up by breaking in to a certain building while first blowing up a certain powerplant. The backstory to this was about as extended as this description of it and the action was over in a few minutes. Most of what should have been the grand finale seemed to have been landed on the cutting-room floor. But thankfully the very last scenes finally made an effort. Neo met the program that created the Matrix, and we discover a lot more of the background of the Matrices, Zion and even the One. I wish the movie had more of these thinking bits...***END SPOILERSUltimately, Matrix Reloaded is an excellent action-flick that simply does not capitalize on its potential.

gleebs75,9,4,6,27-Apr-06," Amusingly Awful Romance at Its Finest
","In typical Woody Allen style, this film is a comment on pretentious New York City inhabitants, fake and materialistic Hollywood-ites, and neurotic love relationships. Alvy is a somewhat overly intelligent, somewhat pompous, incredibly neurotic and slightly depressed comic. Annie is a woman who only gets pleasure out of smoking pot, is not too intelligent, and is too shy and nervous for her own good. Having these two characters fall in love seems slightly insane in itself, but then again, that's what Woody Allen was going for with this film. In many ways, this film could be seen as kind of a comment on how film portrays romanceÂ—how unrealistic romantic relationships had been portrayed by Hollywood and how the unhappy ending is usually the more prevalent in reality.California (more specifically Hollywood and L.A) in this film is portrayed as a place full of overly tan, vanity obsessed, materialistic celebrities and their agents. Alvy, being the model New Yorker, hates California. Some of the most amusing lines in the film are between Alvy and Annie concerning the others' hatred for the two cities. Alvy's opinions on L.A all seem to hold up, however, so do Annie's opinions on New York. They're entirely polarized cities and the fact that Alvy and Annie don't choose the same city as their city of preference only emphasizes their differences even more. These two people are polar opposites, just like L.A. and New YorkÂ—they don't belong together. Annie and Alvy are not the type of couple that Hollywood usually had fun portraying. They are not the Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett couple from Pride and Prejudice, they are not Romeo and Juliet, they are two people who are completely wrong for each other and know it but somehow can't seem to figure it out. Every time they break up, they fall deeper into their depression because it's another failed relationship, another thing they couldn't make work. They're constantly bickering and fighting, and it doesn't really seem like love anymore after a certain point. It's the kind of love that only two mentally unstable and off base people can understand (and considering Allen's real life love situations, it becomes obvious that he is one of those people). This film is re-defining romance, re-defining how people look at relationships. It doesn't work out for Annie and Alvy in the end, and they both seem to be slightly okay with it. That's how things would have worked out for them in real life, and that's what Allen wanted to portray. If he had been a conventional Hollywood director with classic notions of grandeur and romance, then he would have had them live happily ever after. It's refreshing, for once, for the audience to figure out that not everyone gets that. Not all romances end with a ride off into the sunset.Annie Hall is also a critique of American culture and the elite intelligencia. Alvy and most of his acquaintances in New York are the kind of cynical and judgmental people who are so intelligent that it makes everyone else of moderate intelligence seem like morons and scum. Alvy (even as a child, as we see in multiple flashbacks) has very high standards for people he would consider worthy of being able to share their opinions. One of the most humorous scenes in the film is when he and Annie are in the line to see a film about Nazi Germany and WWII and there is a pretentious man in line behind him spewing off his opinions on directors. When Alvy confronts him about his seemingly terribly wrong opinions, he pulls out one of the directors to back him up. Alvy is the standard that the audience is supposed to hold everyone else up against. He is a neurotic man who never has nothing to say and is usually able to voice his opinion in a witty manner. The irony of this film is its greatest feature. The depressive and cynical comic, who is too into himself to give anyone else the time of day, meets and falls in love with an unintelligent and somewhat boring girl from the mid west who would usually do nothing for him. How could it not end up amusingly awful? Woody Allen is truly at his finest in this film.",Annie Hall 1977.csv

","In the last few weeks, I have been watching all the John Hughes films again, like Sweet Sixteen, Ferris Bueller, Some Kind Of Wonderful (he wrote it) - and it seems that The Breakfast Club provides the most thoughtful insight out of all of them.The story is simple, about 6 kids in detention on a Saturday. What ensues is a film about bonding, the fragile nature of these kids and what it means to be a teenager. In the hands of other directors, this film would have probably focused on comedy too much, to sacrifice for the lack of a ""house party"" scene. But Hughes handles the pacing well, and the film never rushes the development.The characters are all stock - at least we think. As the film progresses, the vulnerability of these kids becomes more apparent. I don't wanna ramble on too much, but this film is the best teenage comedy made in the 80's...with Ferris Bueller.Estevez, Nelson, Hall, Sheedy and Ringwald are all wonderful in this film.

",This movie was pretty much what I expected. A man wrongly accused of a crime is usually portrayed as noble and strong in the face of all the injustice in the world and the bad guys are oozing bile. The movie followed the formula fairly closely.  If it wasn't for the strong convincing performance of Denzel Washington the movie would have been nothing.  Don't you wish that Hollywood could make a movie of this type and show the hero as very flawed but still innocent.  I never watch this type of movie and think I am seeing the truth.  It is an entertainment not a commentary.  This movie with its stereotypes and polar views of good and evil is probably a good example of its type.  It is well acted and nicely photographed.  It breaks no new ground.,The Hurricane 1999.csv
Horst_In_Translation,6,5,9,18-Jun-18," Makes good use of established formulas
","""Hereditary"" is a new American movie from 2018 and maybe, at least at this point, considered the defining horror film of the year. It runs for comfortably over 2 hours, which is unexpectedly long for the genre and the most known cast member here is Oscar nominee Toni Collette who of course has a history of strong horror films and this one adds further quality to her body of work in this field. Writer and director is Ari Aster and this is his very first full feature movie. Nice way to start a career if we ignore his short film works for a little moment. As for the cast, we also have Gabriel Byrne in here who was probably the one cast member that is the biggest reason to watch the film. He does not have Collette's material, probably not even Wolfe's material in terms of awards bait, but he is as quietly convincing as I hoped he would be. Now for the film itself, it was handled pretty convincingly. Some scenes stay in the head really while, for the most part, the film also works as a whole. The one scene that stayed in the head the most was of course the fatal party and everything that resulted from it as well as the chase for the teenage boy at the very end. Interestingly enough, he is at the core of my favorite scenes it seems. The very final scene with the diabolical references and the evil deity parts was not really to my liking. Maybe there the movie tried to be too much for its own good, but it seems critics disagree, so watch for yourself. Jump scares are okay as a whole, executed profoundly as everything else about the film really.Apparitions of the old lady add their fair share too as do the parts with scene stealer Ann Dowd and her talking with spirits. But this also resulted in maybe the weakest part story-wise as seeing how scared Collette's character is after this particular scene, I just cannot believe she is all for talking to her own daughter immediately only one or two scenes later. But of course there are some flaws for a film with this running time. Taking this into account, it still went by pretty quickly and you could see the creativity and wit attached to the project. For people who love horror movies more than I do, maybe really adore them, this is close to a must-see. For everybody else who does not hate the genre, it's a good watch nonetheless I assume. There are really many strengths to it, sometimes also fairly simple aspects like the young daughter's physical looks or the many references about severed heads and even if they are pretty gross like the one with the pigeon, you just cannot look away. Other moments like the many dollhouse references did not work that well for me, but it is also all subjective here what you will like and what you won't like. Maybe these parts are exactly what some others will appreciate. So overall, there is no need to hesitate for me in what I give this movie, namely a positive recommendation. The highs were higher than how low the lows were if you know what I mean. And also the positive sides were more frequent than the negative parts in terms of the story. Shame they messed things up a bit at the end. Still go watch it, at best when it's dark outside (or inside) of course. Thumbs-up.",Hereditary 2018.csv
blanche-2,8,0,0,20-May-13," spectacular portrayal of spectacular artist
","From 2007, La Vie en Rose is the story of the great Edith Piaf, a little woman with a huge voice, a huge soul, and huge eyes, who transcended her beginnings and became an international star.Marion Cotillard is Piaf, and what a magnificent job she does - ethereally beautiful in sections, she creates an unforgettable portrait of a woman who loved and sang and lived with great passion but in the end was her own worst enemy due to drugs and alcohol. Like so many people, she became addicted to painkillers after an accident, and both her parents are depicted as alcoholics. I can only describe the end of the film as shattering and heartbreaking due to Cotillard's fantastic acting.That's the performance - now to the movie. A life like Piaf's isn't easy to get into a couple of hours, even a couple of hours plus like this one, so events in her life are skipped or go by very quickly. Director Olivier Dahan moves from the end of Piaf's life to the beginning and the middle throughout, and in my opinion, he does it expertly. What's not so expert is the hurried way some of the incidents are presented, for instance, the murder of Leplee (GÃ©rard Depardieu) - you would have to know Piaf's life to follow what happened in those scenes.Also, the reappearance of certain characters after many years had passed - one look at the message board tells you that many viewers didn't know who they were. I'm a complete snob and I admit it, so why people thought the older blond woman who approaches Piaf and raves about her work was Marilyn Monroe is beyond me. Okay, it wasn't the best Marlene Dietrich I've ever seen, but she had her hair like Dietrich's, she was obviously a mature woman, everyone is so reverential -- if you think people were reverential toward Marilyn Monroe like that in those days, think again.All in all, I found the film excellent, despite incidents and relationships (Yves Montand, and the fact that her best friend Momone was actually a half-sister) being omitted. I need to also add that Pauline Burlet, who was the 10-year-old Edith, was absolutely beautiful in the role.Highly recommended for the story and for Piaf's incredible voice, heard in most of the songs. Cotillard performs ""Frou Frou"" and Jil Aigrot does two numbers, the truncated ""Padam"" and ""L'AccordÃ©oniste.""",La Vie En Rose 2007.csv

","Meryl Streep has a wonderful gift: she is one of the few people in the world who can take any role in any movie and play it to perfection. And even though she's best known for dramatic parts (Kramer vs. Kramer, Sophie's Choice, The Deer Hunter), she can shine in comedies as well. The latest example is The Devil Wears Prada, where she delivers another Oscar-worthy turn.She plays Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway, one of the most prestigious fashion magazines in America, and is famous for her tyrannical attitude and continuous demands. Unfortunately, her new secretary, Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs (Anne Hathaway), doesn't know this when she first sets foot in the office. Once there, though, it doesn't take her long to realize that working for Miranda will turn out to be a nightmare. Especially if you're a naive young girl who knows absolutely nothing about fashion...Andy has to face the truth: she's a fish out of water in this world where a size 6 (hers) is the new 14, everyone wears clothes they don't even like, as long as it's expensive and gorgeous, and the high point of the year is going to Paris and meet all the big personalities. As for our ""ugly duckling"", she really struggles to fit into that universe, with some support from Miranda's gay assistant Nigel (Stanley Tucci, absolutely hilarious) providing comfort between the impossible assignments, whether it's finding a manuscript of Harry Potter 7 for her boss's twins or booking a private flight when all regular airlines are blocked by a storm.First-time director David Frankel (who previously worked on Sex and the City) approaches the fashion world with a poignant eye, showing it for what it really is: populated by cynicism and appearances, with just an occasional glimpse of unexpected humanity surfacing here and there. Instead of pandering to mainstream rules, Frankel and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna keep the movie mean, and therefore relentlessly fun, until the end. By doing that, they provide us with one of the year's best comedies, given increased value by some deliciously quotable dialogue (""...You have no sense of fashion.."" ""I think that depends on..."" ""No, no, that wasn't a question"") and memorable acting: Hathaway manages to gain the audience's sympathy thanks to her simple charm and unpretentious behavior, while Tucci turns what could have been an annoying stereotype into a likable, genuinely amusing supporting character, yet they're both second to Streep's impeccable, mesmerizing work. If the film's great, it's largely due to her.Want to see something truly, undeniably funny this year? Make it Clerks II. Something less risky and profane?

russellalancampbell,10,1,3,30-May-15," The Small Roles Hit Home runs
","The stars come out to shine in this film but it is very rewarding to notice some of the smaller roles that make ""Judgement at Nuremburg"".1)Mr and Mrs Halbestadt as played by Ben Wright and Virginia Christine as representations of the ordinary German people. They have been caught up in something beyond their control although there is a hint that they were at least passive supporters of Hitler. ""I won't say that Hitler didn't do some good things. He built the autobahn,"" says Mrs Halbestadt. The pair are now caught up in another situation (The American occupation) in which they feel that passive subservience is the best strategy to survive. They have lost a son in the army and a daughter in the bombing and now they must feel the unease of being under the control of people they don't know and who do not understand them. Both actors do a great job of portraying an apprehensiveness that the whole nation must have felt.2) Schmidt as played by Paul Busch. He is a driver for Judge Heywood and the first German we see. He is relatively young and stares straight ahead and beeps aggressively at the sparse traffic as he drives the American judge and senator through the bombed-out ruins of Nuremburg. We are sure that Schmidt feels much more than he is prepared to reveal as he drives on and follows the commands and answers the questions of his new superiors with a stiff obedience.3) Otto Waldis as Pohl, a right hand man at a concentration camp. His emotionally detached response to the question of how the extermination of millions of people could be possible tells all. ""It's possible. It all depends on your facilities."" The response answered the question of the logistics but also the mental approach that could make it possible. Otto Waldis as Pohl is chillingly matter-of-fact as he eats his lunch and repeats what were the actual words of a real Nuremburg Trial defendant - Rudolf Hoss.4) Howard Caine as Hugo Wallner. He plays the husband of Judy Garland's character, his wife who is being persuaded to testify against fellow Germans. The couple have a very modest shop as a new start after the war and fear retribution should Mrs Wallner testify. Caine's performance again gives the ordinary person's sense of despair and frustration at having the repercussions of the war continue to impact on their lives. The couple have obviously suffered and are now being asked to sacrifice by people who move in circles far above them. It is easy to say they have a moral duty to testify against injustice and evil but it is they who will bear the consequence and Hugo Wallner's response is not totally indefensible. ""I say to hell with them and to hell with you.""5) Olga Fabian as Mrs Lindnow. A brilliant portrait of the dangers of giving ordinary, powerless people power over others - the basis of why Nazism was so popular. She, even years later and after a devastating war, enjoys another chance at being party to the cruel persecution of Mrs Wallner. Nazism had given Mrs Lindnow her moment of power and importance. The power to be cruel to others and have it legitimized by law and government has never been better depicted than in the person of Mrs Lindnow.There are others but I will let you look for them.

","As a review I would start with the filming. It was great New York City all over. And that's good. Pasting the city scape into the movie was done well - as if the editor knew the city well. And I like that. Casting was OK and did not reach too far into the Toy world of greed and money, but instead used the filming to tell the story without Glitz and Glamour to prove the point of the story. Music was OK without adding pop or street crawl. It was good and basic background music that fit, as I said, OK. The writing was great as far as it went. Perhaps I just needed More !! And a sequel just may be the answer. I can't see a series erupting from this - but a sequel could move into other realms of the Sci-Fi world's movie stories. Much like Michael Caine's ""Harry"" moved through time and space - so could ""Limitless."" There was a terrible amount of holes to be filled throughout the movie as the end came near. And then the ending of the story. It was like an Aesop's Fable with someone telling you the moral of the story instead of it spinning in your own mind. That leaves too many questions, loopholes, and a scenario that yearns for a sequel just to see the final ending. It is an 'almost' great movie only lacking in answers. Everyone played their part well - from the filming, casting, crew, writers, actors, etc. Something is missing. . . And I hate to see DeNiro not finish something once he has taken the Pill of Success.I give this movie a 7 out of 10. I could see another production easily raising that much higher. But we know that won't happen in this world of Copyrights. My biggest problem (and please forgive me for this fault I have always had) is that this movie like so many other good but not great movies end too quickly without giving me satisfaction. Perhaps this should have been a Mini Series expanding on all the aspects of the characters much deeper - expanding outside of Downtown Manhattan - expanding the plot longer for each change and outcome of situations.

Thinking perhaps he is unique in doing so, Stone decides early in the movie to focus on Alexander's sexuality. Okay, yes, he was bisexual. Many Greeks at the time were. NO BIG DEAL. But apparently this is a big deal for Stone, and he emphasizes Alexander in the bedroom more than on the battlefield, cheapening the man that conquered a huge area in such a short span of time. If that weren't enough, Farrell plays Alexander like he is an emotional fool - crying for more scenes in the movie than most men have cried in probably a lifetime. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but I doubt Alexander was forever whining and crying as much as he is in this film. Since I knew the real history, I was shocked that the story had been changed so much to reflect weakness instead of power. At over a three hour running time, this movie is a real waste to see, and is even slower considering Stone uses slow motion in many of his scenes. No part of it is worth watching, and the performances are sub-par to the point everyone employs there own little foreign accents to seem like they are part of the time.

","As a Trekkie, I had set very high expectations for this film to actually be a true revival of Gene Roddenberry's famous 'Star Trek'. After stepping out of the cinema, I found myself surprisingly satisfied with JJ Abrams's attempt at a brilliant science fiction, yet still managing to keep most aspects of the original Sci Fi TV shows and movies we all came to love.Star Trek: The Future Begins, or Star Trek VI as many loyal Trekkies would prefer to call it, used an excellent combination of the prime elements in Star Trek, and fresh, original and clever ideas for a well developed Science Fiction. The theory of warp is correct, Bones hasn't lost his witty behaviour, and even Sulu maintains his fencing abilities. New comers to the franchise will also learn how Kirk managed to ""beat"" the Kobayashi Maru, and see his rebellious attitude. For those who have been faithful from the beginning will be pleased to see Leonard Nimoy appear as an older version of Spock, whilst the ""new"" Spock as been beautifully portrayed by Zachary Quinto. However, to make the universe of Star Trek more exciting to both new-comers and ye-faithful, writers Roberto Ocri and Alex Kurtzman have included time travel, unorthodox (to the Star Trek Universe anyway) action sequences, and brilliant plot twists and character development.What we get from this is a fun, fast paced, thought provoking and original Science Fiction film, plucked from the depths of the Star Trek Universe. Not a moment goes by in this 127 minute epic where audiences, young or old, won't be on the edge of their seats. The plot flows very well, and the film strays from the seemingly new trend of cramming the screenplay with 50 minutes of pointless gibberish. We've been presented with striking cinematography which has been stunningly strung together with clever editing, well written and delivered dialogue, and a cast which couldn't be more accurate to the original unless we revived James Doohan and DeForest Kelly from the grave (or space in Doohan's case), and rejuvenate the whole cast. The acting is flawless, with brilliant character history. The film contains stunning locations helping to bring the Star Trek Universe to life. Again.With all the above mentioned, it's hard not to praise this great product of Sci Fi, except perhaps the lack of use of the LCARS computer system. There is only one notable disappointment in this film, however. And that's the lack of Oscars it won. The directing was evidently fantastic, with the great charisma of JJ Abrams keeping everyone together. It truly deserves more praise.It is very safe to say that all audiences, even those who don't like Star Trek, will be able to see the greatness in this amazingly orchestrated piece. There are many words to sum this film up. Epic, brilliant, astonishing are just some of the one-word praises anyone in their right mind can award this film.

","OK, I liked this movie better than Traffic.  That insulted my intelligence and meant it too.  This movie isn't full of intelligence, but its not the director's intent.  He wants to make a crafty movie, but all he pretty much knows is schlock.  He did The Ref (Denis Leary driver).  'Nuff said.This movie had some decent roles.  Johnny Depp is in another drug movie, Ray Liotta (this is the third new movie I have seen him in this week Hannibal and The Heartbreakers were the others) is in another Goodfellas, and Penelope Cruz did decent in her manipulative female role.  The acting was as good as you could expect from this kind of movie.  Paul Rubens was, um, interesting as a homosexual drug dealer, but he was fun.  I guess that is the only thing different about this movie from every other one, is that its fun.The plot of this movie (which is a true story, and the film is 6 years in the making), is basically 2nd half of Goodfellas mixed with Requiem for a Dream.  But its the nice version of it all.  Its the all-American version as the titles so eloquently present.  Low down: Guy grows up poor, decides he wants to be rich, gets hooked up with drug dealing.  We watch as his dealing progresses through the decades.  He then is busted not once, not twice, but three times.  And the third time is supposed to be a tearjerker.  He gives up all he loves for his dream of living a peaceful life with his daughter.The editing is straight out of the Goodfellas college.  Chock full of freeze frames, pauses, and just an overall feeling of crumbling goodness, the movie owed more to Scorcese than to Demme.  The narrative, all in flashback (ala Goodfellas) is told with distinct settings for the years and obvious music throughout.  And, no, I am not the only one who remembers Goodfellas, one of the greatest movies of all time.  The big reminder is in Ray Liotta, this time father of Henry Hill.But, you may get the hint that I thought the movie was utterly worthless. I didn't. It was fun in a mindless what am I watching sort of way.  I would recommend watching Goodfellas for a mafia/drug syndicate movie, and Requiem for a drug syndicate/destruction of American dream movie.  But, if you want a sugar-coated pill, see this movie.

","I saw this film toward the end of the Cannes Film Festival; it edged out all the others I'd seen, 30 of them, because of its wonderful story; history, politics and fantasy woven into a fabric spun by a superlative creative team headed by Guillermo del Toro. In comparison to this, his latest effort, del Toro's other films only hinted at the depth and breadth of his talent. In this film, much as I pride myself on foreseeing the outcome of most stories, I could not guess what would happen next. The film is quite long, yet suspense is sustained throughout. The music is some of the best I've heard in years, so well suited to the action that you almost don't notice its specific effect because of how well it is intertwined with the visual, emotional and intellectual experience.In my opinion, del Toro's ""...Labyrinth"" deserved to win at Cannes over the Ken Loach film, ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"". Actually, everyone I knew at the Festival who had seen both agreed with me. And the 22 minute ovation speaks clearly for the effect on the audience. It's hard to imagine that any film could beat it in a context other than Cannes where they have marked preferences, bordering on obsession, for certain directors.Let's hope that the late December opening favors an Oscar nomination which it should win hands down, unless some other work of genius appears on the horizon. That doesn't seem likely because at Cannes the somewhat disappointing array of films was attributed to the fact that not much great product is being released this year. I might add that I had already seen Volver prior to Pan's Labyrinth, and I maintain that Pan is the better film. For me, it displaced all three of my top films of the year. I do love The Departed but, luckily, that's in another category which does not threaten Pan's access to Oscar. If I had to choose the very best picture of the year, without limitation by category, it would most assuredly go to Pan's Labyrinth for it demonstrates del Toro's originality and brilliance as both writer and director.",Pan's Labyrinth 2006.csv

","Woah!!I was blown away by this film! The trailer, for once! Didn't give any of the gory bits away! I mean it was just spectacular! I can't remember the last time I seen a viscous, dark scary intense film like this! It was just amazing!!The opening was ace! The Abomination of the girl getting burned from the start by her father & her threatening him before she dies when he then shoots her with a shotgun! Then the opening title 'Evil Dead' appearing on screen! Epic!!I also liked how the story starts off with Mia getting increasingly stressed through out the film & things rapidly spiralling out of control! Eric & David go into the basement only find animals hanging from barb wire & a book which Eric, so foolishly reads the chant, to reawaken the demons! Then things really get nasty!! When Mia says they'll all die! I was like! This'll be great!The blood was just top notch! I mean the bits I really liked were when Mia Cut her tongue in half with the Stanley knife! Man that was ace! When Natalie got possessed & started shooting both David & poor Eric who had been ripped to shreds by her & Olivia who had previously (after cutting her mouth open with a knife which was jaw droppingly wicked!!) stabbed Eric in the chest, then he fell back & hit his back on the toilet seat, then she stabbed him repeatedly with a syringe!! Just epic! Then Eric killing her with a piece of the toilet lid & causing her head to be splattered all over the floor! Natalie then getting dragged into the basement! Then the Stanley knife cutting through the tongue which I just mentioned! Then Mia who is now possessed threatening David & calling him a f**king idiot & Saying his sister is getting raped in hell! Badass line! Natalie cutting off her arm after being bitten from Mia when her wound becomes infected! Extremely gory!!! Then her getting possessed & nail gunning David & Eric! Eric who has already sustained so much excruciating pain & suffering! When Natalie starts whacking him & David with a steel rod!! David saves Eric's ass again after he gets victimised & walloped repeatedly with the steel rod (Poor guy!)then David shoots off her arm with a shotgun & kills her right after she becomes un-possessed! Eric after saving David from getting drowned by Mia dies & gets forgotten about until then end when he comes back alive & stabs David in the neck, when David nearly kills Mia, until he dose the live burial & jump starts her heart back when the spirit 'supposingly' dies! David then shuts out Mia & he & Eric get burned to death inside the cabin which David previously soaked with petrol!And just when you think it's over it rains blood & Mia & the evil spirit have a final showdown! Mia kills the spirit after it chases her through a shed, nearly stabs her with a machete! Vicious! Then Mia, chainsaws the spirits foot off & cut the spirit in half killing her! Then the rain stopping & her looking toward the sunlight & limping toward the exit in the woods!Overall, a very, very , very!! Gory, viscous & epic film! Very impressed with this one! Horror fans, you won't be disappointed! Go see this film! Can't wait for Evil Dead 2! Another remake which hopefully will be good! 10/10",Evil Dead 2013.csv

","I had a chance to see a preview of this movie last night. Actually it's quite entertaining - even for someone like me who is a teacher of the history of religious history. The film is well cast and moves along to a good conclusion. However I am growing increasingly tired of people talking about the factual correctness or otherwise of this film. People bandy around comments about what happened 2,000 years ago as if we have concrete evidence - we do NOT! All of the gospels were written long after the events and supposed to have happened - we do not have eye witness testimony! Let's be clear about this. Christianity is a matter of faith - if Christians choose to believe that somehow a vigin (mis-translation from the aramaic almah - which means a young woman - by the way for you fellow Latin scholars ""it did not say that Mary was ""virgo intacto"" - was impregnated by a ""holy spirit"" thats up to you. But look at the evidence - scant as it is - that exists. Christians borrowed the faith from the Jews. According to the Jewish faith - Jesus was married (he had to be - he was a Rabbi - you cannot be a Rabbi unless you are married). Also at the wedding in Cannae, Mary Magdalene anointed his feet with oil and wiped them clean with her hair - this is EXCLUSIVELY done as part of an ancient Jewish marriage festival. Dan Brown takes some of these ""facts"" and creates an entertaining story. Just enjoy it for what it is!

As I've come to expect from the Coens, the visuals are striking but they've never been this beautiful before, and at no time - unlike - in previous films, do they seem merely to be there as an exercise in cleverness. But what makes this film is the excellent comic performances from even the smaller roles (several of whom are Coen regulars) - Even though the characters, as in many coen films, are (slightly irregular) stereotypes the performances give even the shallow characters a depth and makes the scenes even more funny.

A person can easily slip into the flow of the story. This is what happens with O Brother, Where Art Thou?The story takes place in rural Mississippi during the depression years. The costumes, settings and props look so authentic, and the actors are so engaging and play their roles so well, and they are so well directed, that there were times that I forgot that this was a modern film. The Coen brothers' unusual (and often disturbing) sense of humor is in practically every scene of the film. But when the humor is disturbing, as it is in most of their films, there is a reason for it; it is a comment on human weakness and human triumph. Their films are the medieval Morality Plays of the late 20th - early 21st century, and O Brother, Where Art Thou? Is one of their best.","O Brother, Where Art Thou_ 2000.csv"

maurice_yacowar,8,3,7,07-Dec-15," Abandoned astronaut rescued from Mars
","The Martian centers on a triangulation. One point is the vastness of the cosmos. Hence the astronomical distances and calculations and the recurring shot of Mark Watney (Matt Damon) as a minuscule dot moving across the red landscape of Mars. The other immensity is the astonishing achievement of human technology. This works on two levels: (i) the science demonstrated in the mechanics of space travel and communication and (ii) the equally impressive scientific effects in the composition of the film itself. Cinema as well as science is celebrated in the film's dramatic visuals. When Martinez jokes that Mark is ""just a botanist, not a real scientist,"" the gag makes all of science an index of mankind's achievement. Of course, it's Watney's savvy as a botanist that enables him to grow potatoes in his own excrement on Mars and thus to survive. Botany is the science of earth, here the balance against the science of space. The third pole, in tension with these two immensities, is the worth of the individual human life. However impressive the realization of space travel and man's new technology, the film's essential value is one person's life. The team members vote unanimously to risk their own lives to save their colleague. In the rescue's climax two space-suited bodies float through space, clinging to a slender sash until they can clutch each other. That teamwork extends outward to the national community â€” when all America (i.e., CNN and Times Square) gathers to root for Watney's rescue â€” and internationally, when China volunteers its advanced propulsion system to save him. For the latter to happen, humanity has to transcend politics. Both countries' scientists have to do an end run around their respective governments. In the more conventional version of teamwork, two of the astronauts end up marrying and having a baby. All the examples of connection, teamwork, community, are based on the value of the individual life, which should â€” but does not always, or even often, OK, maybe ever â€” transcend considerations of the collective. Fiction reminds us what we should make our reality. The film draws on earlier fiction forms as well. Watney's ingenuity recalls Robinson Crusoe and the Tom Hanks and Spalding affair. Pillaging the unclaimed seas, Watney styles himself Blondbeard the Pirate. The individual life is what traditional fiction has celebrated and it remains the primary value even amid the impressiveness of ultramodern science and the newly fathomed reaches of the universe. Watney recites his log as a reminder that all the splendours we're seeing are at least balanced and usually trumped by the value of the individual consciousness.",The Martian 2015.csv
lordofthestrings86,8,5,6,30-Jun-06," A Classic
","At the beginning of this movie it seems like it is just going to be another World War II movie, but it is not. There are no battle scenes; there are only stories of the events from overseas. Not many movies show the after effects of war. Many will just show a lot of violence to try to do better in the box office. This movie focuses more on a touching story. Also, for this movie to be released at the same time as many soldiers were coming home, it was not only a timely movie, but it must have been important to the soldiers for it to be accurate.When we are shown Fred trying to catch a flight home in the opening sequence, he is not exactly welcomed with open arms. I can only imagine what that must have felt like to a returning veteran. Not only that, but also to come home and struggle to find a decent job and having no other choice but to return to work as a soda jerker would be a such a shame. That was hard enough for Fred, but Homer probably had it the worst. He came home with no arms and found his life was turned completely upside down because of it. I liked that in the end though things worked out for him. As for Al, he came home and had a pleasant family and his old job waiting for him. All three of them had different ranks from different branches of the military, but when they returned home they were just like everybody else trying to survive in the rat race, rather than the fox hole.Even though it is definitely obvious that their paths will cross again early in the movie, I liked how the three stories intertwined. The film also builds suspense subtly, possibly without the average viewer even realizing it; like how we never see Homer's hooks uncovered until near the end of the film. Naturally, Greg Tolland does a great job in the cinema photography department. Deep focus is put to good use; they did not use it just because they could. The scene where Homer is playing the piano and Fred is in the phone booth in the background is a prime example. I also noticed a lot of creative shots done with mirrors throughout the movie.I found this movie to be quite good overall. I usually do not like long movies like this unless there is something special or unique about it. What I liked most about this movie was good storytelling. That is what I always look for the most in a film and this one has it. I think the movie is deserving of the numerous awards it received.",The Best Years of Our Lives 1946.csv
DICK STEEL,2,18,53,24-Nov-12," A Nutshell Review: Breaking Dawn Part 2
","And so we finally bid farewell to one film franchise that managed to survive the odds at the box office, propped by die hard fans and the curious, or by those, like me, who are completist with high threshold of pain. Despite negative and scathing reviews, the Twilight films suffered no dent in its revenue stream, and having the audacity to split the final book, like what Harry Potter did, to bring more money for the studios. But unlike the boy wizard's final installment, Breaking Dawn actually didn't have much content to justify the split, other than to dangle in its trailer an all out slug-fest, turning it into an action film with what I thought was an extremely shrewd move to get detractors into seats, just to see their hated characters getting ripped to pieces.Or not. There were a couple of inherently strange and twisted plots and subplots in the franchise that I wonder just what's brewing in writer Stephenie Meyer's mind, having to go against the established grain that vampires can survive under ultra-violet light, and sparkle at that, while also developing X-Men inspired mutant powers in addition to Superman like abilities. I suppose one has to buy into Twilight's logic in order to enjoy it, but if it keeps pushing the envelope of the ridiculous, one can only call it a day, with this movie churning out a finale that I'm not embarrassed to reveal would be something for comic book movie fans, if only it had the guts to stick to what it did, rather than to cop it out, exactly in the same way how Ong Bak 3 did it.But what's more disturbing are, firstly, already revealed in Breaking Dawn Part 1, was that the already dead Edward (Robert Pattinson) can actually impregnate Bella (Kristen Stuart), which even the Volturi, headed by Aro (Michael Sheen) deem impossible to happen. But it did, which events from that film, culminating in the third party Jacob (Taylor Lautner) having to sexually groom a female infant, who will grow at breakneck speed in this installment. Let's not forget he's a wolf too, so you can do the math. Fantasy romance is one thing, and some lines of decency shouldn't be crossed, considering that the novels were targeted at a particular population demographic.In many ways this followed the formula employed by the slew of many superhero origin movies, with Bella, now immortal and very powerful, showing off and discovering many other new found abilities. With every challenge thrown her way, be it trying to stave off her instinct for human blood, to dealing with slightly more mature issues in reconciliation with her dad, there's nothing to even make her break into a sweat, which kind of makes it very boring indeed. And that's not all, considering that the story had thrown a lot more cardboard X-Men characters on screen, from those who can deliver electric shocks to some who can control the elements, just to fill up some half hour worth of CG laden mano-a-mano, only for the rug to be fulled under one's feet. This overshadowed the main thread of having tell the Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) story, a human-vampire hybrid who is the great unknown, with powers unseen and an unbelievable growth rate, having a pet wolf sworn to be by her side in Jacob.Director Bill Condon really had his work cut out for him in making the movie, having to put up with cringe-worthy lines that will induce one to roll one's eyeballs, many times over. The acting by all from Pattinson to Stewart to the many support acts all showed a certain eager tolerance to be over and done with this. Michael Sheen hams it up in really boring fashion as the all powerful judge, jury and executioner, while Dakota Fanning probably signed on the dotted line to pay the bills, having to utter absolutely nothing, but to turn up in the office, show her face and act nasty. In fact, everyone did just that, including the leads, If looked at on the whole, it's suffice to say this film franchise started off quite brightly (heh), only to have stretched itself too thin based on really lightweight material by its author. One can only put lovelorn and infatuation on screen for so many films without the feeling of repetition and deja-vu, before finally reaching its goal of a certain idea that was realized in the final installment - the crave for power and immortality, as can be seen from Bella's smirk each time someone mentions she is powerful. I suspect the story's none other than a stroke of one's ego and fantasy.For the target audience, perhaps this film franchise is gold. But to the rest, well, this is something destined for the books as one really strange film anomaly.",The Twilight Saga_ Breaking Dawn - Part 2 2012.csv

If Svlvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Stathom, Bruce Willis, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Steve Austin are your idea of top heroes, you'll be in action heaven. Okay, they're missing a few, but that's still quite a lot of literal man power in one cast. And with two sequels, they've added a few more to the cast with each installment.There's really no way to go wrong with a movie like this. No matter who your favorite action star is, he's guaranteed nearly equal screen time as the others and he's guaranteed an impressive action scene or two. If you like wrestling, shooting, street fighting, or martial arts, you'll be a happy camper. No matter your age, if you're a teenager and like to see guys who are the same age as your dad beating people up, if you remember going to see these actors in the movie theaters, or if you've always referred to them as ""those new young stars"", you'll enjoy seeing them age with grace, dexterity, and pizazz.",The Expendables 2010.csv
hollykmccluskey,10,2,4,07-Jan-12," My new favourite movie
","I loved this movie so much that I created an IMDb account just so I could write a review. This movie is full of great action and effects, mystery and intrigue, but what makes it so much better than many recent movies with similar themes is that it is full of heart, and characters that you really care about. The entire thing is laced with emotion that, at several points, you can really feel in your heart, and this is helped along by the beautiful soundtrack. Elle Fanning's performance makes me think that she is set for an Oscar one day (she's less annoying than her sister, let's put it that way), and although child actors are often extremely annoying, this certainly wasn't the case in this movie. What I found especially enjoyable about this movie was all of the allusions and references to some of Spielberg's greatest early work (Close Encounters, ET). Of course, he was the producer, but this is not a lazy copy. Although you can predict some of the main plot points, there is not a moment of this film that is boring, with each individual scene throwing up a surprise, stunning action, snappy dialogue, or emotion. I think this is a movie that most people will like. It's a story of healing, friendship, and homesickness, but it also has some awesome explosions, and a pretty scary...well, you'll see...",Super 8 2011.csv

He calls upon all those living nearby, including some wolves to see what can be done to take care of the man cub. They all agree on looking after him but they fear that one day, Shere Khan, the tiger will find out and come after the man cub, whom they have named ""Mowgli."". One day, they all get together, after being informed that Shere Khan is nearby and they decide to send Mowgli to the man village and Bagheera, the panther should take him back. Enroute, they bump into Baloo the bear and some monkeys, who try to kidnap Mowgli.Inspired by Rudyard, Kipling, who was born and lived in India during the British rule, from his novel ""Mowgli Story,"" this is very well adopted for the screen by the master of animations, Walt Disney.

","There's lots to love about this film....brisk tempo, exotic intrigue, fleet-footed action sequences...the best of which were displayed in many of my favorite films of this genre: the Bourne trilogy, The Fugitive, etc.The Unknown is propelled forward quite effortlessly by these elements...until, surprisingly, then end. Has anyone experienced that moment in a commercial flight when the smooth, intense acceleration of lift-off and ascent subtly disengages to settle in for level flight? That's usually the point when people (those not jaded by excessive air travel, that is!) break out their books, iPads, Air Malls...the moment when the thrill is gone. I felt something of that shift watching Unknown draw to a close. The coveted ""unpredictable plot twist"" just didn't deliver me through that sling-shot feeling which so gripped me in movies that expertly employed the device in the past (I'll never forget my gaping jaw in The Sixth Sense...totally, blissfully blind-sided). I remember looking at my wife, after the big revelation (no, I won't spoil) with a look that said...""I'm not feeling it"" Could we be at that unhappy moment, ladies and gentlemen?

oneguyrambling,7,0,0,27-Dec-11," JJ Abrams makes his update of The Goonies.
","I knew nothing about Super 8 going in aside from the trailer, that JJ Abrams made it and that Steven Spielberg was somehow involved. Since watching the film I have seen a JJ Abrams interview and read a review that totally gave a major plot development away.I will try not to do that here, as I think I would be pretty p*ssed if someone gave away such information prior to me watching itÂ… Super 8 is set on the cusp of the 80s in a small town in the United States named Lillian. In the opening moments we can see that there has been an accident in a local steel mill, moments later we learn it was the mother of Joe, a local boy (I would say 'teen' but he is really still a 'boy').With the summer break arriving and both Joe and his policeman father still coming to grips with the unexpected passing, Dad thinks Joe would be well served spending his free time at a youth camp.Joe decides he'd rather commit his summer to helping his portly budding director chum as he finishes up his homemade zombie opus. Joe will be on makeup and special effects duties.So unbeknownst to Dad, Joe and five other local kids head off in the late evening to complete some scenes, the unexpected inclusion of young Alice only sweetens the deal for JoeÂ… When the filming of the first big scene of the night is interrupted by a massive train crash that occurs within metres of the 'set', the course of the entire summer is instantly changed. And probably their livesÂ… whatever.I might digress here by saying that the train crash is so spectacular and action packed that it seems determined to subvert the very laws of science and nature. For almost two minutes after the initial impact carriages and debris are still hurtling about the place, always perilously close to one kid or another.But with no-one hurt (!) the shaken sextet gather up their stuff and head home hoping that the approaching vehicles saw them, and more importantly that their parents were aware that they were even out of the house.The train wreck is understandably all over the news the next day in Lillian, but the kids swear that they will not tell a soul that they were there, nor that they saw one of their teachers at the scene and strongly suspect he had something to do with it.I'll leave the exposition there, but can inform you that the how/why/what/where and who's? are all answered in the ensuing hour or so.The secret to enjoying Super 8 to the fullest is understanding what it is aiming to be. In my opinion this is a film that aspires to be a 21st Century equivalent to The Goonies, a light, fun and most of all non-confrontational film for kids.Super 8 is perhaps less focused, less creative than The Goonies, and features many big explosions and other noisy distractions near the end, but it has no real violence nor truly scary scenes, and no sex or profanity to speak of.Like The Goonies it isn't really that hilarious or even action packed, but it moves along at a swift pace and never causes you to check your watch or even look away. Super 8 is hardly Die Hard, The Last Boy Scout, Bad Boys or even Aliens, but you could do a lot worse. (And I didn't name Bad Boys because I think it is goodÂ… I don't.) Final Rating â€“ 7 / 10. An action film with 'other' elements to keep the younger lads content, with a sort-of romantic subplot building to make sure the girls don't leave.I'd much rather lil Billy n Bessie spent a couple hours watching Super 8 than the latest Saw knock-offÂ… or Saw itself for that matter.",Super 8 2011.csv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Not really certain what to make of this one. On one hand, it is a remarkable biopic about a fabulous singing talent who lived an extremely troubled life. From a film-making perspective, it is all over the place. At times beautifully filmed, yet the non-linear presentation creates a mess when told over such a short period of time.One thing for sure, Marion Cotillard is truly exceptional as the troubled Edith Piaf. What a transformation Ms. Cotillard makes from the wild, drunken youngster to the broken down, spunky forty-something whom life has blown by. If you doubt the physical transformation, let me remind you that Ms. Cotillard was the beauty from last year's Russell Crowe film, ""A Good Year"".Terrific support work from Sylvie Testud as Piaf's friend Momone, Emmanuelle Seigner as her prostitute-turned-surrogate mother, and Gerard Depardieu as the nightclub owner who first recognizes this stunning talent while she sings on the street for coins.Director Oliver Daham may or may not be a Piaf worshipper. He seems to pull no punches in making the point that she got few breaks in life, but also brought a significant amount of her pain onto herself through drinking and self wallowing. He does capture Piaf's amazing ability to burst through the pain and display the fantastic voice regardless of the moment's challenges. He does his best directing at the house of ill repute where young Edith gets dumped by her dad.The film leaves many of the personal life rumors untouched and only mentions Yves Montand once, and throws in a quick scene with Marelene Dietrich ... both who figure large in those rumors!

","Many of the World War II films contemporary to the War are finely acted, or full of carefree sing-and-dance numbers. Un-bitter pieces with clear conflicts and villains. This film is released in 1977...the same year Star Wars came out - and allows for a different mood. Having sufficient distance from the World War, with two other American conflicts in between, a more ambiguous view of both the Allies and the Axis powers emerges. Not that the Nazis are suddenly good guys, but they have their problems too.The plot is influenced by the point of view of all of those having to take orders from above and follow those orders to their best ability. Even when they know failure is more likely than not, even though ""what was supposed to happen"" didn't happen and now they have to improvise, not only to save themselves, but to save the other guys that are counting on them.To my eye, this film combines old-school film-making, real craftsmanship in both scale and detail, while navigating the plot's tightrope of tough decisions and lucky breaks. Beautifully illustrated for both the Good Guys and the Bad Guys is the notion that the men in the field suffer when commanders have lost situational awareness. A degree of satisfaction may be removed for some viewers due to the absence of a clear hero,winner, or lesson learned. All-star casts don't always ""work"" but this one does and I would argue it contends with The Great Escape just on that particular point. Jamming all those jewels into one setting sometimes makes for gaudiness, more than elegance. Not so for either film! Like a good chocolate chip cookie, with chips in every bite, there is star power enough in every scene to make each worthwhile to consume, just on performances alone.",A Bridge Too Far 1977.csv

","A good, solid job, no more, no less, but it could have used more focus on the flashbacks to Altman's life in Vienna before she escaped in 1939.Billy Wilder, who grew up in Vienna, once said that the Austrians were the cleverest people in the world â€“ they had convinced everyone that Beethoven was an Austrian and Hitler was a German. After the Third Reich lost, the Austrians managed to portray the Anschluss as Hitler's first conquest and themselves as his first victim. In actuality, Hitler was welcomed with immense enthusiasm and large numbers of Austrians were devoted Nazis. That's not surprising because Hitler's view of the world was essentially Austro-German, both the belief that the Germans were the natural rulers over an empire of Slavs and the ferocious middle class anti-Semitism.Late Hapsburg and post-1918 Vienna had a large, prosperous Jewish upper middle class, prominent in finance, industry and intellectual pursuits, thoroughly assimilated to Austro-German high culture, who had been protected, if not exactly embraced, by Kaiser Franz Josef and the Hapsburg aristocracy. They were also envied and hated by the gentile craftsmen and shopkeepers of Vienna, who repeatedly elected anti- Semite Karl Lueger as mayor despite the opposition of the Kaiser and the government. Lueger was a populist reformer, a proponent of social welfare legislation, and a great builder of infrastructure, not unlike LaGuardia. A devout Catholic himself, Lueger realized that any populist mass movement in Vienna would have to be anti-Semitic to succeed, and he regularly denounced the Jews. Hitler saw him as a model, both as an anti-Semite and as a charismatic politician. Until very recently, he was memorialized in Vienna street names, and there are still statues of him there.The movie's best scenes are street scenes in Vienna in the aftermath of the Anschluss, where Jews are forced scrub anti-Nazi graffiti off the sidewalks, to paint ""Jude"" on their businesses, and to have their beards and sidelocks shorn. The crowds of gentile onlookers are not merely curious; they're as excited and happy to see justice being done as crackers at a lynching. In Altman's dealings with modern Austrian bureaucrats, the movie subtly conveys the sense that, though not Nazis themselves, they are content to see the Jews gone and have no more intention of giving back the loot than Americans have of giving Texas back to the Comanches. What Altman wants from the Austrians is a confession that they are the knowing receivers of stolen goods and that their ancestors participated enthusiastically in the theft.

","I really wonder who's job it is to vet and approve scripts in Hollywood. The story was written in 1996 and only went into production in 2007. Perhaps someone knew not to make this film.The story was just so terrible. Until Charlize Theron's character revealed her powers the story was developing, let's say, routinely. After she revealed her powers the film went from bad to worse. The concept of the story was just so uninteresting. As with many Hollywood action blockbusters the only thing I suspect that keeps people watching are the A list actors and action scenes, which as it turns out I thought were very poor also. The fight scenes between Will Smith and Charlize Theron were pretty ordinary. The origin and powers of the two ""heroes"" are not explored or explained, but let's face it, the audiences aren't supposed to think too much watching this film, they are just supposed to ooh and ahh and Will Smith and Charlize Theron and at how cool their powers are. There was zero chemistry between Smith and Theron, despite the endless strange looks between them.It seems Hollywood has run out of superhero comics to make into films that they are resorting to creating their own. I think we should establish a rule when in comes to superhero films. If Marvel or DC didn't write it it should not make it to a cinema near you, and if it does stay far far away.

RJBurke1942,7,0,4,17-Feb-10," A fantastic allegory â€“ and an allegorical fantasy.
","Imagine an alien inter-galactic space ship arriving above one of the major cities of the world. Wait â€“ that was already done in The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). There's nothing like sticking to a good formula, though...In this story, however, the world doesn't stand still; instead, the space ship does, hovering, blocking out the sun over a major portion of the city (in this case, Johannesburg) and, no doubt, interrupting the tanning efforts of many would-be sun worshippers. No matter, because the poor aliens' ship is broken, and its crew descends to earth for help â€“ only to be corralled into alien ghettos by downright unfriendly humans who just treat them like, well, sub-humans. Now, just why the aliens â€“ called prawns by the alienist humans â€“ allow themselves to be so imprisoned is poorly explained. But, that's part of the delicious allegory, however.Essentially, the movie opens with a private company â€“ MRU â€“ beginning the process of getting all those no good aliens off their butts, outta those slum dwellings and outta sight into to some other corral 250 kilometers away from the city, and â€“ let's face it â€“ outta the way of the humans too...From that point, the satire is poured on, thick and fast, as the hero â€“ some would say jerk â€“ in charge, Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) sees the eviction and transportation scheme going to pieces when other factions muscle in with more permanent ideas â€“ like, death for the aliens, for instance. By the end of a bad day for Wikus, a worse one for the bad guys, and a cornucopia of crunching collisions between machines, men, and aliens, the viewer might be left drenched in the sweat of excitement â€“ but, thankfully, not in the gory blood, body parts and guts that are liberally thrown about and which often spatter the camera lenses. All good fun, hey...For me, the best part about the film is the comedy supplied by Wikus as he tries to save the day â€“ for himself, largely â€“ and the unintended (?) hilarity of the fight sequences between the bad humans and the good aliens. Talk about over the top gore mixed with humour: Nightmare on Elm Street is kid's stuff by comparison. Hang on, Nightmare is kid's stuff...Oh, well, while on the topic of other movies, you should know that District 9 slavishly copies species metamorphosis from The Thing (1984) and The Fly (1986), powerful weaponry similar to that in the latest Terminator offering, and gallons of gore from the Predator series. So, all in all, Distruct 9 â€“ sorry, District 9 is a pretty darned good action flick. Technically, it's very good too: doing for $30 million what cost Cameron's backers $300 million for his Avatar adventure, but without the 3D, of course. And, while on Avatar, you'll note distinct motivational similarities between Wikus in District 9 and the marine hero Jake in Cameron's epic; and you'll also see the organic/machine merge â€“ as in Avatar â€“ to let rip the ultimate intelligent killing machine. The cinematography, CGI and editing all meld to great effect for a frenetic, and often funny, 112 minutes.In sum, as pure escapist entertainment it's an interesting film, with an even more interesting semi-documentary structure to it at the beginning and the end. Hence, overall, I'd recommended it to those who like to see something different in sci-fi â€“ and combining a not-so-subtle message about intolerance, which, as some would know, has been the subject of cinema ever since D. W. Griffith made Intolerance in 1916.Plus Ã§a change, plus c'est la mÃªme chose, as the French say.",District 9 2009.csv

","An Assassins' Marriage I highly recommend watching the movie Mr. & Mrs. Smith because people from various age groups would enjoy different aspects of the film and because there are a lot of suspenseful parts that everyone would find entertaining. Furthermore, the overall theme of the movie is one that many people would find interesting.My experience with this film has always been enjoyable. I have seen this film on various occasions, my first being when it appeared at a local theater in town. I also bought the film later when it first came out onto DVD.Ages from teenagers to adults would enjoy this film. Teenagers mainly because it is a suspenseful story mixed with drama and comedy. It is well done for young adults also because the strong emotion shown in the scenes is appropriate for their age as it makes the mind think. Lastly, for the adults, there are a lot of marriage concepts and difficulties that occur that all mature adults can relate with.Suspense is a necessary extreme for many movies. It allows people to become involved in the film and it definitely makes those confusing moments seem okay for you not to have total understanding. Many people aren't faced with suspenseful situations like this on a daily basis, so when they are faced with them in movies, they seem to be somewhat uncomfortable to the audience. When they solve the moments in the film, people feel as if they have become ""one"" with the film. People enjoy suspense; it makes them feel as if they can't turn off the film. They get hooked and connected to it because they don't know what could happen next. Suspense is a big aspect of film that should be included on all movies in my opinion because it attracts the viewer.A theme is a movie is also a requirement that draws the viewers. You can't have a movie that doesn't have a theme; it defeats the point of a film. There has to be some reason for the movie to have been made. The theme in this movie would be easy for people to relate to since many people have been in love or thought of it. Love and relationship are a very common theme in many movies.The film is a high quality movie that everyone should try and watch if they are into a good theme, suspense, some thrills, classical cinema, and a great love story.",Mr. & Mrs. Smith 2005.csv

I felt like his business partner and friend, Donnie Azoff, was a miscast, and, although enjoyable to watch, he doesn't look or seem like a stockbroker, or someone involved in this type of business. Although DeCaprio provided a stellar performance, the development of his character was only partial, and I felt like I was left hanging in the air. What happens to his ex-wife? What does she do?

Plus, the constant references t the music market ploys and happenings are priceless.The characters are believable. There's always an Alex Fletcher in every pop group or boy band such as there always will be a Colin in each one (Justin Timberlake, Robbie Williams, etc.).

That's really the only explanation I have for the incredible overrating of ""District 9"".This sci-fi movie starts out with a very interesting premise, of aliens being stranded on earth, forced to live in a slum, and constantly abuses and scammed by the humans. The first thirty minutes of the movie, shot in mock documentary style, are actually very refreshing, interesting, and poignant.

Instead, the movie soon evolves into a fairly standard action romp/buddy movie..and carries with it just about every clichÃ© in the genre.Granted, the action is decent and it seeing alien weaponry disintegrate stuff never really gets old. But when there is no disintegration going on, you can't help but cringe at the unbelievable sentimental moments, the incredibly predictability of the second half of the movie, and the vast amount of plot holes.I kept hoping there would be some great twist that explained why the vastly superior aliens allowed themselves to be trapped on earth and treated like dirt, or why exactly one of them bothered to try to return home, or why on earth somebody would but surface-to-air missiles in a slum, or a dozen other things.

Another scene where Alice (Milla Jovovich) is being chased by the dogs and she shoots them and there is a close up of the 9mm Umbrella Corporation bullet falling to the ground and when she runs up the wall and kicks the dog (totally wicked!)

I have watched this movie over and over (about 50 times not joking) and I have listened to the commentary which is great and pretty funny too and I bought a huge Resident Evil poster with Michelle's autograph on it!

","So I'm sitting there in the theater with my mum and my dad and the movie is about to commence. I'm a really big Disney fan, so that, in addition to Josh Gad being my favorite actor of all time, I was naturally very excited to lay my eyes on this fresh piece of cinema. The picture starts playing and my pulse is racing like a deer in the headlights and whaddya know, all of a sudden, the characters burst out singing. Like what the heck? Who does that? Can someone explain to me why some dudes sawing ice would start singing? In my opinion, the film's biggest plot hole. It doesn't make any sense. I simply do not understand why characters in cinema sing. The only good part of the movie is Olaf and it is because he is of Josh Gad.

Sparrowmaniac,9,3,4,23-Feb-07," Diamonds are Death
","Blood Diamond is one hell of a movie, and I will rate it as a must see.Definitely is the best movie I have seen this year so far, and i felt mighty surprised that the Academy Awards have snubbed this movie in the nominations especially in the best Picture category which I feel it rightly deserves.What can I say about a movie which revolves around such a sentimental and touching topic ? Illegal Diamond trading in Africa and the civil wars is the primary theme of the movie. The makers of this movie have joined these two ideas and produced a superb script. With some amazing casting, this movie has been brought to life by Mr.Danny Archer and Solomon Vandy. Leonardo DiCaprio seems to be getting better and better with each Academy Awards nomination he collects. This being his third, he is a very strong contender for Forest Whitaker. The character of Danny Archer the shrewd and cunning diamond trader who exploits the system, the government and the poor fisherman, farmers to get the diamonds. But even then late in the movie we find a soft side of him, when he sacrifices his own life to save the fisherman and his son. We find out about his horrific past. Djimon Honsu's portrayal of the fisherman is again superb. The poor fisherman estranged from his family by the war, finds his son taken by the rebels, brainwashed and fighting for them. His wife and daughter in a refugee camp. Jennifer Connelly's character Maddy Brown i again precise. A side character who in turn can do anything to meet her own needs, in this case a story about illegal diamond trading. Blood Diamonds. She unfolds the story about the Blood Diamonds and brings down the entire facade.Its really hard to tell your feelings for the movie after the end. I for one was at a loss for words. The one scene where, the fisherman is telling his son,""You are Dia Vandy. You are a good boy, who loves soccer and school. I am your father who loves you and is ready to take you back as my son again."" and the son has an automatic trained on him, will surely bring a tear to ones' eye. The background score for this movie was superb. So was the camera work. Some breathtaking footages about raw African beauty has been captured in the movie.

","The torturous road of South African diamonds to the greedy fingers of an indifferent world makes this new Edward Zwick movie one of the most powerful Action/Adventure/Dramas to come out of Hollywood in a long time. The perfect balance between entertainment and a thoughtful social commentary helps the center of the story to have a real heart and a palpable respect for us, the audience. All this praise and I still have not mentioned Leonardo Di Caprio or Djimon Hounsou but I'm going to. Di Caprio opens a new door, introducing us to a character who is a first in his already extraordinary career. He startled us as a very young man with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" before he fell with a serious case of Titanictis. Now, after a three a long and serious Scorsese cures, this spectacular actor makes me believe that we haven't seen anything yet. Remarkable. As remarkable as the soulful Djimon Hounsou who manages to give the film a visible soul. I was moved and yes, I must admit, surprised.

","I must be honest when I say I have never seen ""The Room"" and when watching this movie I though plenty of times about how I wouldn't be able to get some of the jokes and events that are occurring. But by the end of the movie, I realized I didn't need to, I loved this movie, and it is the best film I saw of 2017. First of all, there is James Franco, who kills it in this movie, you can tell that he has respect for Tommy Wiseau in his performance and how he wants to be as accurate as possible in this performance. I felt like he was actually Wiseau himself. The rest of the performances are phenomenal as well. Dave Franco, Seth Rogen, and all of the rest of the cast are great at what they do. However what also must be stated is the content of the movie itself, because when you look back at the reputation of ""The Room"" and how this movie was made, you realize how easy this movie could have been made. It would've been so easy to take cheap shots at Wiseau and bash on the room by saying how it is going to be so bad and how it ended up being that bad, but the movie doesn't do that. The movie goes in the direction of the why of Wiseau, about how he was not accepted by most of society and decides to make a movie to prove to everybody that he is worth something, which is a really powerful message. Granted, you do get some laughs in this movie, because the movie does highlight the absurd production process of the film, but this movie has layers, and when given these layers, you not only a have comedy telling the stories of production, but you have a heartwarming tale of friendship, struggle, success, and ultimately acceptance, and you walk out of the theater liking the movie more as you think about it.

It has a very modern feel that comes through most in things like the music and the way the characters act. It's one of the earliest westerns I've seen where the heroes of the story are actually the criminals running from the law. In most western films the heroes are the good guys. There were a couple moments in the film that I thought didn't work well. For example, there was a chase montage while the characters were in South America. It had really odd, somewhat annoying music, and it went on for way too long. I didn't like it and even fast-forwarded part of it.

","This movie is fun. It's like a three ring cotton candy circus. It is colorful, graphically intense and also has an underlying deepness to go along with its humor and comic book action. I haven't personally read the graphic novel so I don't know how it compares, but it is hard not to like this movie, unless you personally have a problem with Michael Cera or only want to watch ""real"" dramas like the Blind Side and can't get your head around younger fare.I loved how the movie moved like a comic book, but not in the way Sin City, 300 or Watchman did, this one has a completely different feel. People laughed out several times at the jokes and even though I don't like action movies, the actions like people changing into coins and video game effects kept me interested. The only way I could describe it is if you put Ghost World and Some Kind of Wonderful in a blender and baked it, then sprinkled a copy of Juxtapoz on it and frosted it with a Nintendo/Street Fighter glaze. It reminded me of all these things. The acting was very good, so good in fact, I wouldn't single out any of the actors, they were all outstanding and I am glad a lot of the characters looked and acted like normal kids and that made it more believable. OK, maybe a crazy Chinese schoolgirl and the hip, Gothic/indie girl are stereotypes at times, but at least they are stereotypes I want to see.

If you are gloomy going to see this, I am sure you'll feel like you rode a roller-coaster before you get out of the theater. And I recommend seeing this in a theater too and not wait for video, because I think the constant graphics and jokes will be lost on a smaller scene or move to fast to be enjoyed fully.

","I'll admit that part of the reason I have a soft spot for this movie is that it's set in my hometown of sorts, Sacramento, and it involves the broadcast industry (I say ""of sorts,"" because although I never lived in Sactown, I worked there for years..in the broadcast industry). There are some really good shots of the downtown area in particular (Director Robert Luketic obviously likes to open his movies with relatively low view-from-the-sky city shots..""21"" opened in similar fashion in Boston).The movie's principals are Abby (Katherine Heigl), a producer for a local morning news show who's also an anal retentive control freak with no sense of humor. She's under pressure from her boss because the show is tanking in the ratings. Contrast that with Mike (Gerard Butler), a foul-mouthed misogynist with his own cable access show called ""The Ugly Truth,"" where he discusses ""relationships."" Abby runs across the show by accident after coming home alone from an unsuccessful date (which seems to be a common occurrence with her), and proceeds to call Mike during the show when she takes exception to some of his remarks (among other things he tells women who want a relationship to get on a stair master and get some trashy lingerie). Mike proceeds to skewer her on the air. The next morning, she gets a surprise: Her boss has hired Mike and is incorporating ""The Ugly Truth"" into the show, which up until that point has been a milquetoast local version of Regis and Kathie Lee, featuring a husband and wife team who put on a facade of wedded bliss but in reality can't stand each other (he's a moron and a wimp, she's an angry, shrill-voiced harpy). The first thing Mike does on the show is expose this for everyone to see. Needless to say, Abby is furious, and is still unhappy even when ratings improve.Abby then discovers that she has a neighbor who has all the qualities she's looking for in a man (she's so anal she actually keeps a checklist of said qualities). Mike makes her a deal. He'll help her get the guy if she'll get off Mike's back, and if she can't land Mr. Perfect, Mike promises to quit. This is where the movie starts to degenerate into the predictable rom-com M.O.(boy and girl meet, hate each other at first but ultimately end up together). Of course, ""Mr. Perfect"" isn't really the right guy, and you know who's she's going to end up with.That said, there are enough laugh-out-loud moments in this movie to make it relatively enjoyable as ""chick flicks"" go, even for the guys. Gerard Butler is especially entertaining in this, but what makes Mike's misogynistic rants even funnier is when they're played off of Abby's ""what's so funny, I don't find anything funny!"" attitude. This movie is raunchy..definitely deserving of its R rating. Some parts I found hilarious; others made me cringe.

","There is a scene in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" that is particularly noteworthy. The ending of the film. It is one of the best endings I have ever seen on film. (Spoilers ahead.) Instead of showing the two men get brutally killed, they freeze-frame the men and we hear gunshots. Techniques like this make ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" such a great film, from the opening shots to the last.Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) once ruled the west with their Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. They were some of the most successful train and bank robbers in the history of the world. This story chronicles their lives as the law moves in on them and they move to Mexico, where they went straight. Unfortunately, the law still found them, and killed them. George Roy Hill's adaptation of the story is a novel one indeed. It is helped by William Goldman's smart script that seems to give each character a different trait with full, realistic dialogue, and not any cliched lines. There are no classic western ""suicide"" lines, where the hero says something very heroic and rushes out, firing his guns rapidly. There are no Clint Eastwood one-liners. There's humor, but not any ""Make my day"" lines.That's probably one of the other things that is so great about this film. The humor. There is much tongue-in-cheek, and Redford and Newman toss back a lot of lines that are funny. Not only are the lines funny, but some scenes are, too; including a scene where we first see Sundance Kid's amazing weapon talents.And let's not forget the song that made Burt Bacharach famous: ""Raindrops Fallin' on My Head,"" which is used in the bicycle riding scene, which has been spoofed uncountable times by hundreds of films.Newman and Redford give some of the best performances of their careers. I saw Newman's critically-acclaimed ""Cool Hand Luke,"" which was good (I thought it was a bit overrated), but he out-performs that film here.
""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" isn't exactly a western, but more an adventure. An adventure about two guys who used to rule the west, and died after they tried to go straight. A film that takes a look at the lives of these two men and puts it on film. A great film told with style and wit.And one of the last lines of the film is a classic.""You keep thinkin', Butch. That's what you're good at.""

","A comic book adaptation which doesn't shy away from its geeky roots, Edgar Wright's imagining of his titular hero - played expertly by Michael Cera - is as campy, over-the-top and teenagery as you would hope for the portrayal of an unemployed, 20-something who plays bass and has a 17-year-old Asian schoolgirl beau.In a world in which any and everyone seems to be superheroically enhanced, our nominative hero battles the League/Guild of 'Seven Deadly Exes' of new crush, Ramona Flowers.

The battles/fight Sequences themselves do leave something to be desired, but it is clear to see that these are simply the window dressing, nerd-bait designed to appease more ardent fans.

'Aliens' is probably one of the most incredible feats in action film history as well as perfect sequel to an already classic monument of science fiction/horror.Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, the last survivor of the 'Nostromo' after defeating the dreaded 'Alien' and surviving a 57 year ""hypersleep"", she awakens only to be plagued by nightmares of the ""chestburster"" and discover her daughter is dead (a theme that was tragically omitted by 20th Century Fox, and is a pertinent backdrop for the human story). Ripley returns to the planet LV-246 with a group of highly trained space-marines (exposing some humorous Vietnam war clichÃ©s) to do battle with not one, but dozens of the horrifying creatures, featuring H.R. Giger's original design enhanced by the talents of animatronics extraordinaire, Stan Winston. This is a brilliant film-making experience. James Cameron's attention to detail and grasp of technological improvisation is only matched by his ability to bring the best out in his cast of well-crafted characters. Among the highlights are: Bill Paxton as the false fronting chronic complainer, Lance Henrickson as the ""kind"" android, Bishop (the role that made him a genre icon), Michael Biehn as the quiet, heroic leader, Paul Reiser as the greedy company man (who contributes a suspenseful subplot involving sabotage and double-cross), Carrie Henn as a resourceful little girl, plus many more. Sigourney Weaver's Oscar nominated performance gains her notoriety as the first female action hero, especially in the unforgettable climax with the alien ""queen"", and the special effects will make the most skeptical viewers say, ""How the hell did they do that?""

","Remember back in the day with the hit TV show In Living Color had several stars, one of them being Jim Carrey. He was one goofy guy with crazy physical comedy routines that could get your stomach hurting from laughing so much. But could this man make it to the top and possibly bring in a number one movie at the box office? He did, with 1994's smash hit The Mask. I remember seeing this movie when I was 9 years old and being in the theater nearly dying of laughter. I wanted this movie so badly on VHS when it was released, my parents got it for me and I think I must have played it a few dozen times a day. Jim Carrey was like no comedian that I had seen with how crazy this guy would be and The Mask truly showcased his talents.Stanley Ipkiss, a clerk at an Edge City bank, is a shy, luckless romantic who is regularly bullied by nearly everyone around him, including his boss, his landlady, and car mechanics. His only friends are his dog Milo and his co-worker Charlie Schumacher. Stanley is smitten with Tina, a beautiful young woman who his new client at his bank. Later that night Charlie and Stanley go to a club, but after being denied entrance to the Coco Bongo, Stanley is stranded with a broken-down rental car at the city's filthy harbor, where he finds a mysterious wooden mask. When he takes the object home and puts it on, it comes alive, wraps around his head, and transforms him into a wackily-suited, green-headed, cartoonish figure called ""The Mask"", a trickster unbound by any limitations whether be personal inhibitions or physical laws, who cheerfully exacts revenge on some of Stanley's tormentors and terrifies a street gang that attempts to terrorize him.I still watch The Mask to this day, it's one of my personal favorites in my DVD collection. Jim Carrey is still a blast to watch, how could you not laugh during his Cuban Pete performance and getting all the cops that are trying to arrest him into a salsa dance? Cameron Diaz's first ever movie, God I wanted to look like her so badly when I was a kid, she was so beyond gorgeous and absolutely adorable in The Mask. Even Peter Greene made one heck of a creepy villain as Dorian and seeing him transform the mask into something like a monster was just scary. Then seeing Jim Carrey's dog transform into the mask was classic slapstick three stooge like humor that would get anyone laughing hard.

","Disappointing.I always felt the Matrix would have worked better stand alone, with no zippy flying off thing at the end, or need for a sequel.There are two fundamental flaws in this movie and inherent in this franchise.1. Dispel the magic. Some movies work best on mystery. Some work well by exposing all the components. Like with, say Star Wars, the film works better when you don't have all the details but you are thrown in and then out media res. You come in the middle, you leave as fast and without firm resolution. Do we need all explained and to know all that happens after (or in Star Wars case, before)? Do we need to know the function of the Matrix so intimately? Do we need to know the nature of the Oracle? Do we need to see Zion or does it work best as an almost mythological refuge of man, left to our own imagination.2. Does the duration hamper the impact of the film? This film is a schism between waxing low level philosophy and extreme visual effects. Both have their merits when woven well - the first film managed this. Reloaded seems to crave them into the story in long chunks. Too long scenes of action, too long, droning scenes of dialogue. This film would work far better with a more dynamic edit. There are scenes which are overlong, scenes which are superfluous. Overall, these scenes damage the good ones.Aside from that, Neo remains unlikeable and thus is love relationship uninspired. Mr Smith is great and some of the dialogue manages to surface above the general trite philosophy.Watch it if you REALLY want to see the end story of the tale of Mr Anderson. Beware, it's a hard slog, and when you commit to this film, you commit to the next... it's the nature of things Mr Anderson.. better off enjoying ""The Matrix"" and then watching something else.",The Matrix Reloaded 2003.csv

","I had watched this film on cable-TV a few nights ago and wanted to know what the appeal was. I still haven't a clue. Funny? I didn't laugh - not once. Not even a chuckle. Touching? Only when I had an itch. I didn't think anything could be more overrated, over-hyped and completely meaningless and forgetful than the gosh-awful ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" but I was wrong. ""Knocked up"" blows that away for ""why would anyone pay money for this?"" I did not find one character likable, believable or interesting. I was totally annoyed at the whining, the over glamorization of ""E! Entertainment Network"", the over acting and over simplification of these actors AND their characters and situations.Be honest: This feature film WAS an ABC after-school special you paid $12-$15 to see. And I shouldn't compare ABC Aftershool specials to this mess because many of them were light-years in interest, emotion and entertainment than this one.Knocked up starts out well meaning enough - a career woman gets a promotion, goes out to celebrate and gets totally bombed, has one night casual sex with the ugliest guy in the bar, and later finds herself ""knocked up."" She should be so lucky in this day and time.Then I had to sit through what seemed like hours of immaturity from 20-somethings who made other 20-somethings look like caution-to-the-wind alcoholic idiots in the age of STD's, AIDS and all sorts of other things they haven't even named yet.

","I wanted to see this at Sundance, but it was hard to get in to see this one. So it's been about 8 months that I've waited to see it...I tried not to have too high expectations, because usually when I really think a movie's going to be great, it ends up letting me down.  I will say that I wasn't let down, and I enjoyed the story and the acting.  It was a little hard to take Zach Braff seriously as I love him in ""Scrubs""...but all I have to do is see his face and we start giggling.  Every once in a while in this film, I saw ""JD"" instead of Large. But he did a great job in this film, as did Natalie Portman.  I don't want to go into too much detail, but I thought the movie was much too long. For example (POSSIBLE SPOILER) the party scene toward the beginning of the movie was a little too long and depressing.  I got RIGHT AWAY that Large (the main character) was detached and not feeling anything. I'm not sure why the extended ""drug use/spin the bottle/wild sex/anything goes"" scene was needed...to me it just dragged.  As the movie progressed, it was interesting to watch Large become more and more aware, to ""wake up,"" so to speak, yet I still found that many scenes were not necessary or could have been edited. (SPOILER AGAIN) Also, did we REALLY need to see the hooker sex scene?  I got the point when they showed the scumbags drooling as they watched through the peep holes. In all, this is worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of Braff...and Ms Portman. The love story of the movie is rather sweet.  I thought the title was clever, as well.

That's a shame, because it was quite a challenge to do something both appealing and imaginative after the first Matrix, in storyline as well as visuals.

However, those rare good points are drowned in pseudo-suspense, and are only marginally enjoyable, while dangling plot pieces (the kiss with no consequences of any sort, the seraph who's only good enough for a fight), overpresent and boring fights, and positively revolting elements (the induced orgasm, the party, the utterly ridiculous bullet-removal scene) bring acute embarrassment and displeasure.

","""Evil Dead II"" is a gory horror movie for people who don't like gory horror movies. That's not entirely true, as some splatter-film aficionados love it, too, though others protest the Three Stooges-style comedy that predominates after the ten-minute mark. For me, it's a marvel of story-telling economy, suspense, and sustained momentum that manages to be really funny, funny enough that you don't know whether to laugh or scream when director Sam Raimi uncorks his next surprise. Which is a large part of the fun.Amorous Ash (Bruce Campbell) takes his girlfriend to a cabin deep in the woods. Unfortunately, the cabin was occupied previously by a professor studying the Necronomicon, a book of ancient and dangerous lore. Soon all sorts of terrors are forcing their way into Ash's world, chanting ""Things that were shall be again!"" and turning the cabin into a blood soaked shambles. Ash works single-handed, first figuratively, then literally, to stop the ghoulish invasion.Blending comedy and horror was old hat when Boris Karloff was introduced to Elsa Lanchester in ""Bride Of Frankenstein."" But the two genres were never commingled so directly until ""Evil Dead 2."" Nor, before ED2, did you get much comedy in gore sequences. ""Evil Dead II"" would seem an unlikely place to introduce this concept, as it is the ostensible sequel to a movie that was grimly serious about much of the same situation.Is ""Evil Dead II"" a true sequel? Technically, yes, though tonally it plays very different. The key to that is Campbell, who reprises Ash from the prior film but plays him here with an array of silly faces and mouth-agape stunts that would have impressed Buster Keaton. His firm jaw and big teeth are played for magnificently kooky effect whenever there's an opportunity for blood splattering, grinning insanely as he takes a chainsaw to his lover's head or his own wrist.""That's right...who's laughing now!""Well, you are, most of the time. The violence is often shocking, but never in an ugly way, things always progressing in cartoon-like fashion. Raimi keeps the camera in motion for episodes of thrilling humor, like one sequence early on when the lens chases Ash through every room of the cabin, with doors whipping and crashing so fast you never see the joins necessary to make it play on screen. ""Evil Dead II"" was made on the cheap, it even looks cheap at times, but it never plays cheap. The film does have weaknesses. There are substandard performances by the supporting cast or a woolly ending that leaves things up in the air (for a sequel that would wind up being a mild disappointment). None of that diminishes the energy rush one gets watching a film that is as unrelentingly clever as ""Evil Dead II"", so clever it actually gets funnier, if not scarier, with multiple viewings.

","I'll admit that I've never been neither much of a gamer nor an avid reader of comic books aka graphic novels. So, while I understood the gaming world references, there was little nostalgic value in the film for me personally and I had no idea about who Scott Pilgrim is.The movie is definitely an achievement in teen movie genre that faces some problems with identity in the 21st century, IMHO. Michael Cera will definitely make you laugh, he's probably one of those characters you start to laugh at already seeing for the first time in the movie, the jokes are not as funny as Cera's characteristic stupid face and mannerisms. And that's a big problem with this film. You find yourself laughing not about the jokes but about the movie itself. Now, there's nothing wrong with it as Wright obviously intended ""Scott Pilgrim"" to be a stab at stupid action movies and video game clichÃƒÂ©s, among other things, but the attempts at serious drama just get lost in this CGI and Kung Fu or whatever extravaganza...I remember ""Watchmen"" as I had a problem like this with that movie too. You might call it ""style over substance"" as nowadays, at least for me personally, ""Sin City"" like stylized comic book adaptations go far too over the top and it wouldn't be bad, it would be great if only they wouldn't try to attempt serious drama among all the CGI battles and explosions and Ddddddd's running on the street. ""Scott Pilgrim vs The World"", as I said, is not a bad movie as it entertains and gives you a good time. But it's nothing more than that. It doesn't feel as revolutionary in the visual area as Avatar was and the plot, while it could work despite all the massive ""why?"" questions about everything on the screen (why is Scott sleeping in the same bed with a guy who's having gay threesome at the same time), is massacred by empty characters you cannot relate to and who either bore you or are utterly repulsive.It's not a bad movie- it brings new things to teen movie genre, like interesting and clever visuals and cool battle scenes, it entertains and is funny, even if drags a bit at the end. But it isn't particularly good film either, as it's inhabited by ""style over substance"" in all areas and over the top/ exaggerated characters you cannot and don't want to relate to.

","This film highlights the dark cloud over Northern Ireland following the incident occurring on 30 January 1972 in which British soldiers fired on unarmed civilians taking part in a supposedly-peaceful march in the Bogside area of Derry. What happened? Why are they throwing stones?, What triggers the bloody event? Those questions really should have been thought of when producing this film. First of all, as a part of crucial historical event, I feel that this film doesn't give proper introduction to the situation described even though some people can easily relate the title with the incident. Let us be logical, this wasn't the first massacre happened, events like this(whether more or less violent) may occur every day all over the globe to any unfortunate human race, just like the one occurred in Carandiru, Brazil. Despite the improper introduction, Paul Greengrass in a daring way portrayed this turmoil in such an honest, shocking, scary, daunting, disturbing and creepy way. I also admire the way he merged some original footages to the shoot, making it look even more real. The authentic feel of a documentary film obtained through the use of hand-held camera work is superb. This results in stunning realism, one feels part of that fateful day when dialog fails, when a supposedly peaceful demonstration ends with suppressed side stones with water, rubber bullets, tear gas, to lead to the negative lead bullets which crippled the lives of 13 people transforming into a killing with impunity which had no punishment to those responsible.

This film wasn't just good, it wasn't just amazing, i cant find the appropriate words to say how thrilled and entertained i was by this movie. It honestly made me feel like a teenager again, it brought back every punch, every bullet fired and every exploding vehicle i watched in movies and on TV during the 80s. I just simply cannot understand any person who claims to be an action movie fan not enjoying this. I wouldn't argue on the script or acting front for one second, (although i really found Mickey Rourke's monologue surprisingly touching),but in terms of quality and quantity of action this is inarguably a milestone in action cinema.Hollywood has always made a lot of money from the summer films season and the output has changed dramatically since the 80s. I feel they should acknowledge their audience beyond the teens age group and for all the hundreds of millions Harry Potter, the Pirates and the Vampires generate, some of that profit should be put back into funding middle range budgeted films such as this.I don't feel its an accurate perception that these films cant stir the kind of interest they once did, The Expendables box office would seem to contradict that. Even if you view the combined pulling power of the cast as a gimmick which has garnered interest here, i would ask, what word best describes cgi, since it in itself has become the focal selling point of most, if not all, blockbuster trailers now.

","Hotel Transylvania is basically a love letter to the classic horror movies and clichÃ©s that surround them. Dracula is the owner of a huge castle in Transylvania where he invites other monsters to come and spend their time without fear of being judged or hunted by humans. Aptly calling it ""Hotel Transylvania."" The plot kicks off the night before his daughter Maven's 118th birthday. She wants nothing more than to go outside and explore the world but Dracula is reluctant about this because he thinks that humans would kill her without a second thought due to her being a vampire. Things are shaken up though when a human named Johnathan unexpectedly arrives in Hotel Transylvania. Now Dracula has to keep Johnathan's humanity a secret from his fellow monsters and try to stop Maven from developing any feelings for him. Hotel Transylvania is a very fast-paced movie. The humor often flies in your face a mile a minute and each joke will last just long enough for it to resonate in your mind before moving on to the next one. And most of the jokes are actually pretty funny. Granted there's a few obvious puns in there but they're handled pretty well. And the film knows when to slow down in order to let the plot tell itself. Like the scenes with Dracula and Maven. You can tell that Dracula has a deep love for his daughter and only wants to protect her, and that she loves him too but also wants a little independence. Their relationship is actually handled a lot differently than the stereotypical relationship a father and daughter have in animated movies. They hardly ever fight, except for a scene near the middle, and obviously have a mutual respect and love for one another. That was a heartwarming touch that's a real refresher when compared to other animated films like The Little Mermaid.The animation itself has a nice blend of CGI and Cartoon physics. The characters move very flexibly and often make faces straight out of a Tex Avery cartoon which is a style not often seen in CGI. Each of the characters stand out, there's a Frankenstein (complete with wife), a Wolfman, a Mummy even the Invisible Man shows up. There's also one shot gags and side characters that manage to leave an impression even if they only show up on screen for a few seconds, like a hydra, a fish-man, or even Bigfoot. No character seems to overstay their welcome.Granted having the movie in such a fast-pace is gonna damage a few things. While the parts that are meant to make you feel for the characters are handled pretty well they often move too fast to really leave that much of an effect on you. Without giving anything away there's a scene in the end which plays with how humans react to actual monsters that felt a little too rushed and too forced. But overall this film has a lot to keep you invested. Funny jokes, good looking animation and a lot of likable and hilarious characters. The voice acting is pretty good too with an all star cast like Adam Sandler, Andy Sandburg, Selena Gomez and more. I'm glad I saw this movie and it just put me in a good mood by the time the credits rolled. I say give it a chance.

Many scenes, particularly those showing Walter skateboarding in Iceland, or climbing the Himalayas, were very memorably shot with unique camera range and angles. The script does fall into melodrama, but I did not mind this. Ben Stiller was very good as Walter, capturing his shyness and cluelessness so sensitively. I liked Walter's moments with his mother, played by Shirley McLaine in a subdued likable manner. I also liked Walter's awkward romance with Cheryl played by Kristen Wiig, in only the second role I have seen her since ""Bridesmaids."" She was also very relaxed and natural here in a straight role. Too bad we do not see the full strength of her comic skills.I cannot deny that I was disappointed with how the story went. Once we reach the second half of the film when Walter actually stops having fantasies and does things for real already. I know of course that this was the point of the film, that dreams were there to be fulfilled. I just felt it somehow lost the spirit of the source short story.Overall though, this was an entertaining feel-good film that will bring us to places we rarely see on screen. The spectacular photography of the exotic settings demand that you see this film on the big screen. Despite lofty comparisons with Forrest Gump, Walter Mitty admittedly does not exactly reach those heights. However, upon watching this film, you will wonder how something so beautiful-looking could have been totally shut-out from Oscar or any other award consideration.",The Secret Life of Walter Mitty 2013.csv

","All right, This is my first review, so if it's jumbled. Sorry. I marked Spoiler because I don't want to be blacklisted. Any-way, I'm extremely bias because i'm a huge fan of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton and of course the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter. I swear this trio is the triple threat of Hollywood. In my own opinion of course.Okay so The movie. Honestly, I thought it was great. I mean Johnny Depp was impeccable. He plays Mr. Collins, with such depth, and makes the vampire such a charismatic character. I will say that the movie was not as funny as the previews showed. It did have some humor moments though. Tim Burton, is great with putting his dark and twisty with a dash of light into his movies though. I loved the Collins mansion, it was beautiful. The Plot & story line is too known, a bad love and so she damned the whole family. After centuries still holding a grudge. I mean its just predictable. I thought the writing was pretty good, again speaking of a completely bias opinion because of how much I love all three of these fantastic actors / actresses. They shouldn't get all the credit though because Chloe Mortez and Michelle Pfeiffer are damn good too. I didn't see the whole werewolf thing coming, and she did pretty damn good too.

stevensc-31653,8,0,1,11-Aug-17," Surprises on every corner, and astonishingly moving!
","This film is pretty damn moving. That's the best way I can figure out how to explain this movie. ""Good Will Hunting"", directed by Gus Van Sant, is about a young janitor named Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, who ends up being a genius, and solves a very difficult math problem, which grabs the attention of a math professor, but Will has some pretty bad physiological issues leading him to be seen by a psychologist, played by the remarkable Robin Williams. If you have not watched this film, do not continue reading! (Unless you want this film to be spoiled for you) Trust me, you won't regret watching this. ""Good Will Hunting"" really surprised me. I was not expecting this to be such a moving film filled with some great performances. There is so much right in this film, but the first thing that really shines in my opinion is the score and soundtrack. Elliott Smith wrote many songs that are in this movie, and he happens to be my favorite musician. Miss Misery is the PERFECT theme for this film. The last scene in this movie is both extremely heart warming and unexpected. Miss Misery really turns this scene into a masterpiece. I am going to have to talk about the last scene, so if you haven't seen the movie, please go watch it, you will not regret it, trust me. The last scene shows Will gone, and his friend ends up going to his house and Will isn't there. This was super clever, because not even a few scenes back, his friend does say that one day he wishes he could just come knocking at his door, and he won't be there because he wanted to move on to bigger and better things. That's not all though. What really caught me off guard is how the film goes full circle, Robin Williams sees a note from Will, and it says exactly what Robin said in the past ""I went to go see about a girl"", and I started BALLING! The approach to making this film go full circle is amazing. It is just so unexpected, and really shows Will character ark shine, it's just all the right ways not to make a clichÃ© full circle ending, and Miss Misery is playing and it just elevates it EVEN MORE! I really think getting Elliott Smith to write a song for this film was amazingly clever. There was 2 scenes that I thought they should have switched the songs for, because the tone of the song and scene don't fit at all. It's when ""Angeles"" plays in a very serious and sad scene, and ""Angeles"" does not have a dark tone, it has more of a uplifting, but slightly haunting sound. They should have swapped that with the scene that plays Elliott's most famous song, ""Between The Bars"", which is a pretty damn dark song. If Gus would have just switched those songs, it would have made the scene it home WAY harder, it did take me out the scene, because I was confused by that decision. Moving on, the plot is pretty simple, and it's not anything extremely unique, but the approach is, and the passing is perfect. I was not wanting to miss one scene in this movie, because it really grabbed all of my attention. I was not looking at the time, and I really was emotionally invested into Will Hunting. They did not make Will out to be the socially awkward and unattractive nerd that you would expect. Will is actually an asshole, but his personality is called for due to his past. I want to talk about my favorite part of this film, which is the performances. There was no one weak actor here, but Matt Damon's and Robin Williams performances are astoundingly powerful, which really gave everyone a run for there money. The most heart crushing scene in this film is really due to the way the performances were executed, and this is the scene where Will finally reveals what happened to him that has made him so damaged, and it's just so amazingly believable on both sides. I do believe Robin Williams gave his best performance ever in this film on this scene, and likewise for Matt Damon. I was crying like a child, and I never get so emotionally involved in a film, but this movie made me start looking at film as a actual art, I mean come on. If you seen this movie, you will most likely agree with me, because every time I have watched this film with someone else, the other person ends up crying because of this emotional scene. This is THE WAY you make a moving scene, I mean it's just so, dare I say epi-- I can't do it, It would be insulting to this film. I do have to say one thing I think this film is lacking, which is good cinematography. None of the scenes really show beautiful shots or unique angles, they are just pretty lack luster and average, which is a shame because I know Gus Van Sant could do some amazing shots. The reason I say this is because one of my all time favorite films, My Own Private Idaho, has some of the most amazing cinematography I have ever scene in film. I am not saying that My Own Private Idaho's cinematography is anything like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (directed and written by the one and only Stanley Kubrick, and Arthur C. Clarke), but I know Gus can pull of some amazing shots. That is basically my only complaint about this film.

Like a painter, he composes each scene, each frame with tender affection. I doubt you can find a better looking film. The ending of the film is the most cynical, the most depressing, the most emotive of any film I have ever seen. It has stayed with me ever since I first saw it.

ghost_dog86,3,1,4,02-Jun-12," Scarily boring.
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland As a comedy, ""Dark Shadows"" doesn't work at all, but as a film that goes out of its way to alienate anybody who hasn't seen the original 1960's cult soap opera, director Tim Burton (Alice in Wonderland, Beetlejuice) does a spectacular job. Not only does ""Dark Shadows"" fall well short of the 6 laugh benchmark, the eccentrically scattered tone of the film, which stems from this Seth Grahame-Smith (The Hard Times of RJ Berger) script, makes an under 2 hour film seem like a battle of attrition just to keep from falling asleep. Sure, Johnny Depp (Rango, Edward Scissorhands) looks like he had a blast camping it up as Barnabas Collins (his idol, no doubt)and Helena Bonham Carter (The King's Speech) is ridiculously superb here as Dr. Julia Hoffman (for the ten minutes she is in this movie), but for anybody watching, ""Dark Shadows"" is almost entirely a disappointment.Side Note: I understand, there are a slew of other A-list actors in this film, BUT if I haven't bothered to name them, then their performances undoubtedly did not warrant it. Simple as that.This Burton production is a revival of the camp television classic ""Dark Shadows"", now set in 1972, when one Barnabas Collins returns back home to his beloved Collinwood Manor (located in the tiny town of Collinsport, Maine) only to find that his relatives have driven what was left of his once lucrative fishing company, into the ground. Now he must take down the rival fishing company in order to regain his family's prominence. Oh, and did I mention that the head of the rival company is a vindictive witch, whom long ago had cursed Barnabas, transforming him into a vampire after killing his one true love? Oh, I didn't? WellÂ…no worries because that storyline really doesn't add to the entertainment value of the film anyways.The idea of remaking this cult television classic may seem interesting on paper, but in all actuality, the plot here is nothing audiences haven't seen a hundred times before in a hundred other movies. A man (or whatever) from another time is somehow transported to the present day (or near present day) and we watch as he stumbles around, struggling with modern electronics for an hour and a half. So, even thought it becomes quite obvious 2 seconds into ""Dark Shadows"" that, for Burton, this is a labor of love, it all really doesn't matter, because the storyline grows more and more uninteresting as the film progresses. I will say this though; the climax of the film is very entertaining, if not extremely weird in a very ""Dark Shadows"" way. But the amount of boring satire one has to wade through is not worth the payoff.Final Thought: I'll make this short and sweet. As much as ""Dark Shadows"" could not have been directed by any other director, this is clearly not one of Burton's better movies. This is not even ""Adam's Family"" funny. In fact, ""Dark Shadows"" may only work to reinforce the sad fact that the only reason many middle aged people loved the original series, is because they were all seven years old when they first saw it.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

gordansaltirov,1,4,6,20-Sep-11," Very bad film from historical and national point ...
","As you are all aware, Oliver Stone's film on the Macedonian conqueror Alexander is due to open on November 24. We, the Macedonians, the descendents of Alexander's Macedonians, want to inform you that we reject the movie as historically inaccurate for it is not a true story of Alexander as Stone claims it to be. We are particularly concerned by the ""Greekness"" that Stone has given to the Macedonian king.1) Where are the Historical Errors in the film?Stone has Collin Farell (the actor playing Alexander) saying to the Macedonians before the battle of Gaugamela against the Persians that they are fighting for ""the glory of Greece."" Ancient sources do not write that Alexander fought for the ""glory of Greece"" but for that of Macedonia. Three ancient historians detailed Alexander's address to the army before the battle. And each one of them made a clear distinction between Macedonians, Greeks, Illyrians, and Thracians, as four separate ethnicities that composed Alexander's army. Here are the words of the Roman historian Curtius Rufus:""Riding to the front line he (Alexander the Great) named the soldiers and they responded from pot to spot where they were lined up. The Macedonians, who had won so many battles in Europe and set off to invade Asia ... got encouragement from him - he reminded them of their permanent values. They were the world's liberators and one day they would pass the frontiers set by Hercules and Father Liber. They would subdue all races on Earth. Bactria and India would become Macedonian provinces. Getting closer to the Greeks, he reminded them that those were the people (the Persians on the other side) who provoked war with Greece, ... those were the people that burned their temples and cities ... As the Illyrians and Thracians lived mainly from plunder, he told them to look at the enemy line glittering in gold"" (Curt.3.10.4-10) Notice what Alexander told the Macedonians - ""Bactria and India would become Macedonian provinces"". It is for the glory of Macedonia, not for the glory of Greece. The Greeks, are here a second nation of importance to Alexander.Throughout Oliver Stone's film there is confusion whether the Macedonians were distinct people or just another Greeks. Ironically the original Synopsis of the film makes the clear distinction between Macedonians and Greeks. There we read: ""Alexander led his virtually invincible Greek and Macedonian armies through 22,000 milesÂ…His extraordinary journey begins when Alexander launches his invasion from MacedoniaÂ…""Yet although in the Synopsis the Macedonians are separate from the Greeks, and they left from Macedonia and not from Greece, Stone has them fighting for the ""glory of Greece""?! The error is obvious.2) Why the Macedonians and Greeks still hate each other today?Macedonia is now divided between today's republic of Macedonia, Greece, and Bulgaria. The division occurred in 1912 when Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria occupied and partitioned the country, inflicting a tragic faith upon the descendents of Alexander.In the 19th century Macedonia was occupied by the Turkish Ottoman Empire. The Macedonians then were well aware that they, and they alone, were the descendents of Alexander's Macedonians.This is very important - in this same 19th century, the Greeks did not claim the ancient Macedonians as ""theirs,"" on the contrary. The works of the Greeks in the 18th and 19th centuries reveal that the Greeks did not regard the ancient Macedonians as Greeks, but foreigners who had conquered Greece (see Politis 1993:36; Dimaras 1958; Karagatsis, 1952). Politis had cited fourteen examples from the Greek literature from 1794 to 1841 in which the ancient Macedonians are excluded from the ancient Greek world (1993: 40-42).With the occupation of southern Macedonia by Greece in 1912-13, everything changed. Greece needs its occupied Macedonian territory and created new propaganda to claim the ancient Macedonians as ""Greek"". Such propaganda is needed to justify the present occupation. This stealing of the Macedonian history by the Greeks is resented by the Macedonians who have long before the Greeks claimed descent from Alexander, and still do.3) Why today's Macedonians are direct descendents of Alexander?In 2001 it was genetically proved by a scientific team from Universidad Complutense in Madrid, Spain, that the ancient Macedonians and the ancient Greeks were two separate and distinct peoples. It also proved that the modern Macedonians are descendants of the ancient Macedonians of Alexander the Great, while the modern Greeks are not related to either the ancient or modern Macedonians. The lengthy scientific paper which was published and entitled ""HLA genes in Macedonians and the sub-Saharan origin of the Greeks"", concludes the following: ""Macedonians belong to the 'older' Mediterranean substratum, like Iberians (including Basques), North Africans, Italians, French, Cretans, Jews, Lebanese, Turks (Anatolians), Armenians and Iranians. Macedonians are not related with geographically close Greeks, who do not belong to the ""older"" Mediterranean substratum. Greeks are found to have a substantial relatedness to sub-Saharan (Ethiopian) people, which separate them from other Mediterranean groups. Macedonians are related to other Mediterraneans and do not show a close relationship with Greeks: however, they do with Cretans. This supports the theory that Macedonians are one of the most ancient peoples living in the Balkan peninsula, probably long before the arrival of the Mycaenian Greeks, about 2000 BC.""Thus, genetically and scientifically had been proved not only that the ancient Macedonians were not Greeks, but that they are older then the ancient Greeks. You may read the full content of this genetic study at the following web address: http://www.makedonika.org/processpaid.aspcontentid=ti.2001.pdfConclusionPlease consider the Macedonian position when approaching Stone's Alexander. Alexander and his Macedonians would have been appalled by Stone who had tried to make them fighting for Greece, when the ancient evidence says they did for Macedonia, because as the ancient authors testify they were not Greeks.",Alexander 2004.csv

Well, the start of the movie (let's say, the first half an hour)was quite good. And of course, Russell Crowe (who I loved in the Australian film 'Proof') and Al Pacino are good actors. But the film went on forever, everything was so elaborate it just became tedious and overdone; it just didn't manage to reach the point that the viewer became really 'captured' and involved in what was happening on-screen. The occasional witty remarks of good old Al Capone (as I like to call him as an hommage for all his gangsta' rolls) were a relief, but after some time even this became a bit of a bore. He tried too hard to be a clown, it seemed, and it didn't really fit in the basically serious story. It wasn't just as tedious as another Capone film, 'City Hall', which also dealt with corruption on high political levels, but it came quite close. 5 out of 10, I'm sorry, Mr. Mann.

It was supposed to be one person's take on her life.Another thing that I found interesting was that many people have been saying that there was poor acting in this film. I would definitely have to disagree. Before seeing this film, I had only ever seen Cate Blanchett in one film (Notes on a Scandal) and I had thought she was fantastic in it. I love Shakespeare in Love and I love Gwyneth Paltrow and everything, but I think Cate Blanchett should have won best actress in the Academy Awards for 1998 because her role was very complex and difficult and she appeared to master it. Geoffrey Rush was amazing (as usual). There were moments where I couldn't help but picture Captain Barbosa from Pirates of the Caribbeam while he was speaking. One of the things that shocked me was how many people have been saying Joseph Fiennes was not good in the movie. I thought he was absolutely perfect. I saw Shakespeare in Love and was amazed by him and then heard about Elizabeth from a friend and decided to watch it. Before watching the film, I came on here and was reading comments about Elizabeth and was a little skeptical when I started watching it. I was afraid that my good opinion of Joseph Fiennes' acting would be dampened. However, it was quite the opposite. I thought his portrayal of Lord Robert Dudley was amazing and no one could have done it better. Fiennes does not receive the credit he deserves for the role he plays. I thought his portrayal in this movie was absolutely heartbreaking (considering what his character went through). It was an all-around great film and I believe it is a must-see!",Elizabeth 1998.csv

In a fantasy world like Scott Pilgrim (Cera) lives he fights for love, a love that seems like a teenage daydream-crush, and it becomes a problem when I as a viewer really can't root for the girl he falls in love with, and so forth their relationship. The story becomes quite confusing throughout, mostly because the characters are one-minded drawn out in single scenes, before quickly adapting and moving along in the adventure. When Scott faces all the evil ex-boyfriends of his love to fight, he challenges them all in battle-scenes which are too long, noisy and alike, and although I know it's just a childlike film full of wonders and crowd-pleasers, I have to question the twisted plot which involves a supposedly right-minded main character who dumps a genuinely sweet girl and treats her harshly, or the mysterious rock girl who entangles Scott into a web of 'my dad is bigger than yours' games, or that messed up ending?

Jawss6,10,0,0,14-Sep-06," Good Acting and Directing
","I think X-Men was a great movie with very good acting and directing from Brian Singer, the special affects were awesome and the crew did a wonderful job on casting. After seeing it I definitely cannot see anyone else who would have played Xavier's part better than Patrick Stewart. Brian Singer also did a wonderful job with the music and putting the story together to make people think that mutants with powers could very well exist in this world. Many people think that actresses and actors should be perfect with their looks and their features, and there were a few in the movie that I noticed. Being a good director in my opinion is accepting people who may not have the greatest of looks or the greatest teeth. And I applaud the director for this, because I watch too many shows or movies who have people who look too phony.The make up and costuming was very well done, Mystique's costume took a very long time and it was very well done. She looked as if she could exist in this world as a mutant, the contact lenses looked as if they could have been real eyes.Everything was done excellent in the movie, all except for one tiny thing. Not all mutants are going to know how to do self defense, some may know how to fist fight or kick someone. But doing sumer saults in the air, seems fake to me. I can understand someone who may have the ability to jump like a toad, but a shape shifter or a wolverine. Just seems fake to make all the characters perfect in fighting skills. This is only my opinion.Still the movie was great and was done well, just wish they could have kept either Toad or Sabertooth alive as well. Not all villains who can't fight well should be killed and have the best fighter live.",X-Men 2000.csv

izzys_art,9,6,9,11-Mar-17," The most brutal spiderman I've ever seen
","Oh my god, this movie was BEYOND AMAZING. Includes a few spoilers.First I don't really wanted to see this movie because I didn't like Andrew Garfield in Spiderman, but I pretty liked war movies, so I decided to give that movie a chance and it was the right decision. I don't want to explain the whole story again, so here are my pro's and con's about Hacksaw Ridge.+ The cast. Andrew Garfield at it's best. He plays the jerk in the beginning so well, his smile, his eyes, everything seems so real to me. His voice and how he turns into a soldier more and more is unbelievable. Also liked Teresa Palmer and Sam Worthington. But well, everyone was great. + The story, because almost everything is true. It's simple but so gross and sad. It's not like there's much backgroundinformation to know about, it's just the story of a young soldier saving people in a part of the 2nd ww. + simply: the setting. Everything's dusty and dark and totally destroyed, you can almost feel how hopeless everyone is because the environment is bombed and full of corpses. + The love story. Usually I don't like love stories like this, but I think it's an important point to show what Desmond is going to give up to follow his opportunities. It was simple but so cute and perfect. + The music. Not too much, not too less. Only at the parts where it was necessary and it fitted perfectly. + The original speeches of the soldiers in the end. It almost brought tears to my eyes. + That it wasn't too patriotic. Don't get me wrong, but I don't like movies where people are like ""we are the heroes, everyone else is the pure devil"" + It shows how gross and sad the war is for everyone, not only for American people. + It don't portrays the Japanese people as some kind of faceless killers without a soul.What I don't liked: - That everyone had it's special role. I don't liked that, for example, in the hobbit, too. There's the small one, the young one, the old one, the I don't know one. Here we've got the teacher, the thin one, the naked one, bla bla. Hm, not that cool. - They should've done the film a bit longer, I don't know. It doesn't showed that much of a character development and for example the love story, it was like: HEY THERE - married. You know? - They don't showed a few important facts in the end. In reality, Desmond rolled over the.. (don't know the word) and wanted to save other people first. Actually he got hit by a sniper, but Gibson don't wanted to show that because it might look too unrealistic to be true.To sum up: Hacksaw Ridge is an almost perfect movie for people who like love stories and war movies at the same time. It's so inspiring that someone did believe in something so hard and became a hero, even if the conditions are the worst. It was kind of sad, interesting, terrifying and funny at the same time. Really well done!",Hacksaw Ridge 2016.csv
mgibbs003,10,2,5,29-Dec-05," Excellent Movie - Not overly religious
","Got this for Christmas and have already watched it 3 times. I really enjoyed the story, and thought the scenes and dialog were wonderfully crafted. After seeing it three times, I started to notice little things that were mentioned in the director's commentary...like the problems they had with the snow, etc. But overall, the quality was much better that I would have expected from an independent film.Some critics have said that this film was too preachy, or too Mormon. I disagree. I don't think I heard the word Mormon at all in the movie...in fact, the only clues that Deacon was a Mormon was that he was a missionary (if you knew that the Mormon church had missionaries in Germany before WWII), that he did not drink coffee or smoke, and that he came from Snowflake Arizona (a place where there are a lot of Mormons). I would not be surprised if some people just thought that Deacon was just a good Christian. His explanations of his beliefs to the other soldiers could be shared by just about any person who believes in God.Actually, the only thing I found unbelievable was the LACK of swearing in this movie...not that I didn't mind it, but I would say that soldiers in real life often have a much more colorful vocabulary. However, the lack of swearing, in my opinion, help to focus on the real message of the movie, which is that in war, there are always two sides, and they are BOTH human sides.",Saints and Soldiers 2003.csv

","Dallas Buyer Club is a great American biographical drama film! Co-written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, and directed by Jean-Marc VallÃ©e. Set in the 1980s, the movie tells the story of a real-life AIDS patient, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) who smuggled unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas for treating his symptoms and distributed them to fellow people with AIDS. Fighting against the orders of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ron must try to manage his 'Dallas Buyers Club"" while facing the opposition from the government agency that originally sent out to protect him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, while the movie is based on true events, it's also highly fictional. A good example of this, is the supporting characters of Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), and Ron's transgender friend, Rayon (Jared Leto). Both were composite roles created from the writer's interviews with transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors. While, some critics might see these examples of artistic license as offensive, due those whom resent the reinterpretation of real event historical events; I saw it as a huge colleague improvement. After all, both Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto did very well in their roles. Jared Leto even won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in his accurate depiction of a fictional transwoman with HIV who helps Woodroof. To portray his role, Leto lost 30 pounds, shaved his eyebrows and waxed his entire body to look the part. Nevertheless, it wasn't as extreme, as Matthew McConaughey had to go, through, as Ron Woodroof. McConaughey lost nearly 50 pounds, just to play the role in the film. The severity of the weight loss for these actors is getting way too dangerous. I can see McConaughey having problems, later in his life, because of this. Despite that, he was amazing in this movie. Kinda glad, he won Best Actor for this movie. However, while Woodroof was known for peculiar eccentric behavior, according to those who knew him; both the film and McConaughey made him rougher than he actually was, with all the rampantly homophobic. Due to this, a lot of critics, believe that the portrayal of Woodroof in the beginning of the film, was very inaccurate and somewhat offensive, when many saw him, as a man that didn't harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. While, many of these real-life accounts are indeed mixed. Here is some truth about the guy. The real-life man did do hard drugs, and had a lot of sex, but also he was a family man, unlike the one, we saw in this film. I kinda do, hate the fact, that the movie cut this fact off from the story, because in my opinion, his ex-wives, family members and a daughter could help, push the character study, along, its character development. Despite all that, I do love, how the movie makes the main character transforms from a rotten person to a heroic one. Yes, he starts out as a homophobic, bigoted, promiscuous drug user, but he become very likable, over the course of the story, when he learns to take care of himself, eat healthy, and learns to appreciate and love others regardless of who they are. This is better than most tragic movies, are willing to give us. While, the movie's ending is bittersweet. I love the anti-corporate message demonstrated through drug companies' heartless action. It's true about what Woodroof says about the FDA. A good example of this, is the dangers of AZT when use to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. While, it's true that high doses of this drug is indeed toxic, it's also true, that AZT has worked for many patients at an appropriate dose. The use of AZT as a way to treat HIV/AIDS is still a highly target controversial, medical debate, even today. Just note that the drug does somewhat work, in small doses. Another good thing about this film is allowing the audience, in rethinking their apparent anti-gay sentiments. It indeed, changed a lot of opinions of straight people had on gay people. It also introduce mainstream audiences, to a realistic portrayal of transgender, outside of Comedy or Indies films. I love, how this movie was filmed. Lots of symbolism with the idea of riding the bull, sequences. Loves all the close up, and bait and switch camera movements as well. However, there were some historic inaccurate with some of the sets and props in this film. It's funny, noticing somethings in the background that clearly wasn't there in the 1980s. Overall: the diagnosis for this rodeo of movie has fine performances which are the highlights of Dallas Buyers Club, but you don't want to go believing too much of its history. The movie takes many shortcuts, compressing and compacting its story that it's hard to tell, which sequences are fiction and which are the truth. In the end, it's best for you to watch it, and judge yourself. I do recommended it.",Dallas Buyers Club 2013.csv
l-95363,9,0,0,01-Jun-18," Very good and intriguing movie
","""Do you believe in miracles? Yes!"" The 1980 Winter Olympics can be remembered as one of the most memorable to most Americans. During these Olympics the United States beat the nearly unbeatable Soviet Union ice hockey team. 
Gavin O'Connor the director starts the film by taking us through the past of what's been leading up to the Olympics and the Cold War. Some of the events include the gas crisis, Watergate, and the death of Elvis. O'Connor then takes the audience through the process of selecting the United States Olympic ice hockey team. Kurt Russell takes on the role of head coach Herb Brooks. Russell takes the role to heart by adapting to his ruggish and critical style as he was known for. Brooks says ""I'm not looking for the best players, I'm looking for the right ones."" Herb selected his team after the first day tryouts only asking his assistant coach Craig Patrick (played by Noah Emmerich) what he thought about his list of names. Throughout the film the United States ice hockey coach Herb Brooks pushes his team to the brink of both the physical and mental limit by making them skate ""Herbies"" and take tests he wants to see how far he can push them. Eventually the team pulls together and plays as a team instead of as individuals. Brooks uses the players emotions to motivate them and ignite their passion to fight through the different pains that they have to be their best. As the Olympics continue the United States is able to defeat various teams until they get the to semifinal game against the Soviet Union. In this game they are able to defeat the Soviet Union which can be seen as one of the biggest upsets in sports history. Two days later the United States play for the gold medal and defeat Finland by a score of 4-2 completing the Miracle. 
The audience can most closely connect with head coach Herb Brooks. We not only see Brooks as a coach, but we also see him as a dad and a husband. In the movie we see Brooks's family life. We see his wife Patti (played by Patricia Clarkson) supporting her husband by putting her needs aside in order for Herb to chase his dreams. Even though she sacrificed her needs we still see her get mad at Brooks in different times throughout the movie. An example of this is when Patti asks Herb to pick up one of the kids and Herb responds with ""You'll figure it out."" Patti tells Herb that ""we never had this talk...never. You never even asked."" What Patti is referring to is that Herb never asked if it was okay to take the job as the Olympic coach he just did it because he wanted a gold medal. In 1960 Herb was part of the United States Olympic hockey team until a week before the games when he was cut. The United States then went on to win the Gold medal and ever since then his dream has been to win a gold medal. 
The use of music throughout the film is very important. In a film music can help set the scene, make you feel as if you're there, and help build anticipation. For example, before the puck is dropped for the the third period of the Russian game, dramatic music is being played. Also Coach Brooks makes the players skate ""herbies"" after they tie the Norwegian National team. As the players skate you can hear their blades carving through the ice with a deep drum beat in the background. During this drill Brook's exclaims ""The name on the front is a hell of a lot more important than the one on the back."" Brooks wants the players to realize that they are not playing for themselves, but for their country. As the movie progresses the team gets better and more cohesive. The music changes and gets faster, lighter, and more upbeat as they increase their skills and to show their comradery with each other. 
O'Connor uses different transitions and angles to help convey the different emotions seen throughout the film. He uses the most common transition a straight cut a lot of the time, but he also uses fading in and out to change locations and people. O'Connor uses close up shots of individuals to help us better see their emotions or determination. An example of this is when Brooks makes the players skate ""herbies"" after their loss to the Norwegian National team, there are tight, close up shots of just Herb's head as he says ""Again"" to Coach Patrick to blow his whistle and send the boys. 
Tom Bronson, the costume designer, did a great job helping recreate the costumes for the film. Everything from the glasses, to the coaches polyester warm up suit, to the players equipment and pads (such as the goalie mask) were all modified to fit the era of the 80's. 
A negative aspect of the film would be how Coach Brooks treated his players. At the beginning of the season Brooks treated his players with harsh words and little respect. It seemed as if he didn't care what the players thought of him he just wanted them to know that he was in charge. If a coach were only to yell at you, and always seemed disappointed with you, you wouldn't feel very good about yourself. You would feel defeated, that you weren't any help to the team, and maybe you should just quit. Another negative aspect is that Brooks put all of his attention into coaching and basically forgot about his family. He wouldn't pick his kids up because he thought meetings were more important. 
In conclusion, this was a very good movie I would give it a grade of an A-. At times the movie was slow, but overall O'Connor did a great job directing the film. We see the development of the characters and how Herb Brooks was able to lead his team to victory. Even though the audience may think that Brooks' methods may have been inhumane in the way that he coached them, ultimately he helped the players come together as a team and built character in each individual. We were also able to see into Brooks's family life and the toll it took on them. Herb's wife, Patti stood by her man and held the family together so that Herb was able to chase his dream and achieve getting that gold medal. The audience was then able to relate to Herb and the pressures that he was going through. The 1980 Olympics can be seen as a true Miracle on ice.",Miracle 2004.csv
Sergeant_Tibbs,6,0,1,26-Jun-13," Fun followup to a series that has a firm spot in my childhood even if Will Smith is turning into a grump.
","I was always a big fan of the Men In Black series when I was a kid, the first film was already on auto-repeat before the second film came out and then that swiftly joined the rotation. It's been a while now and revisiting them recently shows how they reach a much bigger scale than they are clearly shot on, which is impressive, but they are nostalgic. This belated sequel is definitely just as entertaining, even if it's hit and miss and sometimes on the fence. The hits are definitely Josh Brolin, who's predictably fantastic as a young Tommy Lee Jones and a surprise character of which they really should've marketed it more heavily on as it's rare on a blockbuster this scale that I care for a character based on cute reasons (and by care, I mean, don't want him to die yet). This character being an ageless alien played by Michael Stuhlberg called Griffin, who's reminiscent of Robin Williams particularly his eccentric role in The Fisher King, who sees the future in two possible timelines. It wasn't exactly original, but it was approached in exactly the right way to give the film some heart. As always, the score by Danny Elfman brings it together in a truly cinematic package and the visuals are mostly good, the makeup being better the special effects. I'm glad I saw it in 2D as the 3D trailers did not convince me at all. A definite visual improvement on the second film too, which can't patch up its cheapness.The things that missed for me, although it did work eventually as a role reversal, now both Agents J and K are equally disgruntled, which reminded me of the aggression in mainstream ""R rated"" comedies since The Hangover, in which all the characters are needlessly vicious and not intended for character development. It was hard to watch their relationship until Griffin came in, filling in the role J used to fill, but in a completely different way. The villain was also incredibly unconvincing. Boris The Animal, played by Jemaine Clement, which was unnecessary casting, is a mesh of all these horrific ideas that refuse to gel together coming off awkward and excessive, with his features severely lacking purpose to bring it together. Many of the scenes themselves were hit and miss themselves, with some great sequences of very efficient jokes but also cringe-worthy misses, particularly a scene featuring Bill Hader as Andy Warhol. The time travel comes off as very contrived, and there's a ridiculous amount of plot holes here there and everywhere, but it's not worth thinking about too hard, but it's the sentimental twist ending that I'm truly on the fence about. While it did trigger something emotionally with me, it just didn't ring as true, perhaps I'll have to see if it's part of the canon or just tacked on. They really should establish that. Either way, it was an entertaining film and that's all it needed to be.6/10",Men in Black 3 2012.csv

JontheLobsterLover,4,94,202,22-Apr-16," Good premise poorly executed
","Green Room combines both a used idea and a fresh one, and even though I think the concept is very interesting, the movie itself was not. The premise following a group of ""survivors"", who must survive a night as monsters of every kind continuously try to kill them, is the used idea. A lot of horror/thriller movies use that concept in one variation of another. It's a great idea, and it definitely works for most movies. The fresh idea is that the survivors are members of a punk band, who are fighting their way out of a run-down punk venue in the middle of nowhere, while be hunted by white supremacists led by Patrick Stewart. The movie's problems begin with the characters themselves. In horror/thriller movies some sort sympathy for the victim(s) needs to be there, because if you don't care about them, why would you care if they die? The band members were so unlikable that I actually found myself hoping they would die. Aside from a handful of people, the acting was pretty bad. Patrick Stewart did a good job as the leader of the skinheads, and Imojen Poots did a fair job as well, even though I was trying to figure out if her character was stoned or in shock. Some of the actors had their moments, but for the most part the talent in the movie was scarce. On a related note, Anton Yelchin has one of the worst cries/screams ever. Parts of the story either didn't make sense, or didn't lead to anything. The sharpie camouflage scene was one scene in particular that just seemed to add nothing. All it managed to accomplish was make the characters look mentally challenged, and not in the way I think they were going for. The characters also die way too quick in this movie for me. A good horror/thriller movie should pace out their kills, not kill two people in two minutes, and then make you wait thirty or so more minutes for the next death.

","Watching Spider-Man, I found myself asking certain questions like: what went wrong?  To answer some of these, I find myself turning to the surprisingly pleasing X-men.  X-Men is superior to Spider-Man for a number of reasons. First, I like the way Bryan Singer was able to take super heros and villains, and place them into the real world.  X-Men looks and feels very authentic to me, and I like that.  Spider-Man never seemed like anything but a a cartoon that magically came to life.  X-Men does the whole origin deal quickly, you get what you need to know, and you get to see a mutant trying to come to terms with her powers (Rogue).  X-Men doesn't waste time though. It quickly introduces its villains and their reasons, and quickly introduces us to the heros that must stop them.  X-Men is about 25 minutes shorter then Spider-Man, but it seems much longer because they are able to get more valuable things done in the running time.  I was never bored in X-Men, unlike Spider-Man.  X-Men was made for much less, but the CGI is much more convincing and the action scenes play out much stronger then they do in Spider-Man.  To final things off, X-Men has a strong cast, but it benefits mostly from a stand-out performance by Hugh Jackman.In closing, X-Men stands alone as a great film.

District 9 is inspired by events in District 6, Cape Town during the apartheid era.District 9 has a mockumentary setting with interviews, news footage, and video from surveillance cameras.In a dystopian Johannesburg in South Africa; humans and aliens called 'prawns' live amongst each other.The 'prawns' live in government camps but a private security company is hired to move them to an internment camp.Neither humans or prawns are happy living with the other on the same ground and the prawns live in poor conditions and suffer intense discrimination and treated like third class people.Sharlto Copley plays the well meaning but dim bureaucrat and son in law of the boss of the private security firm.He has been the patsy appointed to handle the relocation to the internment camp but is sprayed by some fluid in a canister that the prawns were hiding which alters his DNA. Now the person who was the oppressor experiences life as the oppressed.The mockumentary format works very well in this film and it's Copley's performance that carries this film.Copley was unknown before this film, he really grabs the role and also fills it with a lot of humour. If it was not for him, it may had failed or just remain an obscure movie.The setting in South Africa is refreshing and the special effects are very good. Not everything in the story grabbed me, some of the characters were rather two dimensional.The parallel to the events of South Africa are obvious to older people outside of South Africa as it was a daily news story up to the early 1990s.However it is not entirely original as the film Alien Nation in 1988 had a similar theme regarding discrimination against aliens.",District 9 2009.csv

","From the looks of things when I first saw the trailer for SAUSAGE PARTY I thought it could end up being a funny movie. Sure I knew it was from Seth Rogen and that it could end up being off the wall and a bit crude but I'd seen enough of his films to expect that. If you haven't seen the trailer I suggest you do so before watching the movie. You'll see some of the best gags that way. And then you won't have to bother with the movie itself. If you do decide to go ahead, be prepared for one of the most offensive movies you'll ever see. My guess would be that of Rogen and his friends ever read that sentence they would consider it a badge of honor. They shouldn't.The movie is an animated film about the lives of food in a grocery store. Each morning they wake and sing a song about how wonderful it is to be there and with any luck be chosen by the Gods to be taken out of the store. The song has that cheery Disneyesque feel to it but when listening to the lyrics not quite so since about every 4th word is an F bomb or variation of that word.Our story focuses on two food members. Frank is a hot dogs in a package of the same and Brenda is a curvaceous bun in a package located right next to Frank and his group. The two are star crossed loves who have never met but who have ""touched tips"" meaning reached across from their various packages to touch fingertips. Their dream is to one day be picked up at the same time and finally united in the great beyond.Circumstances result in their falling out of a shopping cart and left stranded in the store. Along the way to finding their home they get separated. While Frank's journey results in his learning what actually happens when you reach the great beyond, Brenda is pursued by a bottle of douche with a broken stem intent on wreaking havoc and destroying Frank. High humor, right? The two reunite and Frank tries to tell Brenda that it is all a lie, that there are no beneficent Gods out there and that the great beyond is nothing more than a death sentence for all who leave the store. The two part ways and Frank is now more determined than ever to find proof to show the rest of the store that his discovery is true.Up to this point the off color humor has been fairly tame with a few exceptions going what some would consider too far. And a few of the jokes found here are actually well thought out and funny, in particular the food puns. But the movie isn't over. It gets much much worse.To begin with there is the none too subtle concept on display here involving the Gods and the great beyond. Depending on your beliefs this will either make you laugh or offend you greatly. In essence the story is that God doesn't really exist, Heaven is a myth and you should live your life as you want to now doing whatever you want to do. And I do mean whatever. Of course all of this is done in good fun. Sorry but as someone who does believe I found no fun in the ridicule of those who have faith.If that wasn't enough there are a ton of off color sexual jokes found in here, everything from A to Z. If you think one inanimate object performing oral sex on another is hilarious then this movie is right up your alley. And if the periodic jokes weren't enough as the film gets to the final segment every food or item in the store joins into an orgy the likes of which are not seen outside of the most extreme pornographic films made. If there is a sexual act known to man you will see it performed by food items during this segment.I have little doubt in my mind that pre-adolescent boys will find a way to get hold of this movie to watch together, giggle and then laugh out loud at what they see. They have no idea what it is that goes on between two people so this is their dirty joke, the kind that you laughed at until you were an adult and then realized wasn't funny. Those who are stuck in that age bracket mentally will enjoy it as well or will try and tell you that you aren't ""enlightened"" enough to appreciate the humor on display here. They won't care who it offends and won't care that it is bottom of the barrel humor.The most disturbing thing about this film is that there will be some parents out there who won't pay attention to the rating or consider looking at what the film is about who will rent it for their children simply because all they will see is that it's an animated film. I can't imagine what the affects seeing this would have on those children.I've seen adult animated films before from FRITZ THE CAT to SHAME OF THE JUNGLE. As an adult I could appreciate the things they were trying to say, the standards that they were trying to poke fun at and understand where they were coming from in their method of talking about the topics. This film has no motivation other than to talk dirty, be nasty and slam anyone who believes in God. The level of humor is Beavis and Butthead on steroids, where simply saying a dirty word makes those involved laugh (watch the extras and you'll see that actually happen). The sad reality is that they are laughing all the way to the bank.",Sausage Party 2016.csv

johnbell863,10,0,2,13-Jul-18," Even better than the first
","Downvote me if you must, but you know the truth. It's better than the first. This sequel was everything a person could ask for in a family-rated movie about time travel. The character flaws actually gave the characters more depth. Marty's reckless attitude got him into a car accident that cost him his career in music in 1985, then it got his future self fired in 2015. He bought the sports almanac in 2015 to take back to 1985 for financial gain, which eventually caused Biff to presumably murder his father, marry his mother, and basically become an unstoppable millionaire casino boss in an alternate 1985. This reminded everyone how young and naive Marty is, despite coming off as mature and cool-mannered. Doc had always been the guiding voice of genius, but he still doesn't fix his time machine when it starts to glitch, and that causes him to be sent back to 1885. This type of character development added an element of realism that is usually completely forgotten in family films. Number two, the special effects and props. And not just computer generated effects. This movie had so many beautiful sets from three (technically four) distinct versions of Hill Valley. The original 1985, hyper-futuristic 2015, alternate distopic 1985, and the classic 1955. Needless to say, they displayed each time period flawlessly and we're left with a seamless story that has enough beautiful 80s flare and eye-popping effects to make this movie truly timeless. Which leads to number three, the plot (specifically how time is represented). This movie went above and beyond what was expected of a sequel to the first film. Fans were left with the cliffhanger of the flying DeLorean entering the year 2015 to save Marty and Jennifer's kids, and that was all they had in mind. More adventures except this time the budget has allowed them to take place in the future. But this movie added in so much more about the ""disastrous consequences"" that Doc always rants about, and those are what time travel fanatics want to see in a movie about time travel. There was much more at stake here than just Marty and his family. This was a story about how one mistake in the future led to many lives ruined in the present, and how the person who made that mistake eventually made things right. That's the kind of hero an audience can root for without feeling like they're rooting for someone fictional. Number four, originality. I don't know when it started, but at some point the directors and writers of the sequels to box office hits began to piggyback off the jokes and plot of the originals. This is lazy and disrespectful towards fans, though they might play it off as a tribute to the classic. But this movie decided to make a new path and they totally stuck the landing.",Back to the Future Part II 1989.csv

Sylvester Stallone leads a band of bad-asses to a war torn country where they blow up everything in sight. The characters are given very little background as it becomes very clear that Stallone's ambition is not in story but in casting every famous action star within reach. It is like a lineup of near retired action stars along with a few newer faces to the genre and nobody gives a sh*t about the whole charade. As director Stallone is more interested in showing off various angles to through a knife or shoot someone. It is one thing for Stallone to round up all of these famous names but why not write them into a story worth telling. This is all bang bang pow and whatever other word they use to describe action. Besides Stallone there is a slew of ass kickers including Jason Statham, Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren among others and they are all given their big chaotic action scene. Stallone plays the desperate hero who goes back into massive danger over a woman. Jet Li gets his ass kicked by Lundgren but we are given that witless conclusion where all is forgiven and Lundgren stands with that stupid grin on his face even though he tried to wrap Li's body around several solid objects.

","An incredible film about a man with autism trying to get through difficult social situations. He also drives cars. Ryan Gosling says about seven words throughout the entire movie, but it's okay really because he is defined more by his crazy, constantly fluctuating emotional responses to everything. Time and time again the driver fails to handle critical scenarios that could change the entire plot, and then somehow make them look deliberate and totally planned. Missing social cues left and right, this is a comedy about a man with an unchecked mental condition trying to pick up a woman. A must watch for all car lovers and quite easily accessible for deaf people as the film itself does not have many lines in it. Why does he drive? Who is he? What is his past? Who knows, all that matters is that he's driving now and he can go really really really fast.

","The other day me and my family rewatched Shrek and it made me realise that this is one of my favourite animated films of all time. The premise of the film sees an Ogre have to go on a quest to rescue a princess from a tower. Mike Myers has become iconic as the voice of Shrek, he is perfect as the loveable ogre. He has so many quick lines that make him such a funny character plus I really like how his character develops as the film progresses. The supporting cast is great too, some would argue that the star of this film is Eddie Murphy as Donkey and he is great in this film. He is just so fast talking and spouting one liners galore that it really works, also his chemistry with Myers is off the chain in this film. Cameron Diaz plays Princess Fiona and she adds an interesting dynamic to the group, she isn't your typical female character and I enjoyed watching her character. John Lithgow plays the villanious Lord Farquad and when on screen he is very entertaining and plays a very fun role in this film. It is also really fun seeing these fairy tell characters in different circumstances. The story is very simple and quite predictable but it is so fun to watch and I really enjoyed the different fairy tale dynamics used in the story and it is a sweet story. The script is great, the humour is really good with some utterly hilarious moments, and some suprisingly emotional moments. The style of the film is great with the large cast of fairy tale characters and the animation moves very smoothly in the film.

","Writer/Director Joss Whedon received so much negative feedback from this film, that he actually deactivated his Twitter, but I can't understand why. It's not that Age of Ultron was a bad film, in fact there were many parts of it that were very impressive, but what bothered people was how Age of Ultron wasn't geared toward general audiences. In the first film, even if you'd never seen a Marvel film, you could follow the story and enjoy it, but that's not the case with the sequel. Age of Ultron is aimed more at the comic-con crowd and parts of it were very confusing to those of us who aren't familiar with the comics that the film is based on. There are a lot of new characters and new technologies introduced in this film, without any kind of background information given, and as the film progresses, it did become confusing. The story begins with the Avengers as a separate faction from Shield, centering on Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and David Banner (Mark Ruffalo) working to develop a new type of artificial intelligence. The pair believe that if they can create this intelligence, everyone can retire and won't have to fight anymore. As always there is a problem though, as the A.I., known as Ultron, comes to life and fails to see the distinction between saving humanity and destroying the planet for the protection of humanity. The film then becomes a race for the clock as the mighty Avengers try to stop Ultron from destroying the planet. We all know that sequels aren't as good as the original, because the creators change things too much and Age of Ultron is no exception. The story isn't even close to as strong as the first film, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good. The special effects are even better and the chemistry between the large cast is much more important then it had been previously. These things set the foundation for a better film, but the story fails to deliver. The Avengers is a monumental undertaking for cinema, with so many well known actors and characters trying to come together as one. The idea is ingenious and the technology behind the whole thing is nothing short of magic, but as far as films go, while I loved the first one, I could have done without Age of Ultron.",Avengers_ Age of Ultron 2015.csv

","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was an interesting film, and one that stands out for its uniqueness in my memory.The movie sometimes plays more like a really long music video than a traditional western, and the soundtrack- which includes ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head""- is wonderful. The movie sometimes takes intermissions to display long passages of time through a series of photographs- all accompanied by the music, of course.The movie is undoubtedly a comedy with only a few serious moments. We follow the trail of the kindly, talkative ""Butch Cassidy"" (Paul Newman) and his polar opposite, the dark, quiet, ""Sundance Kid"" (Robert Redford), and The Sundance Kid's girlfriend, Etta Place (Katherine Ross), who, in typical western lass style fits in perfectly with the two men.Our stars are the outlaws, and as is natural in this kind of film, we find ourself rooting for the ""bad guys"" and hoping that the mean, mean government people (why can't they understand it's not a crime, just another way of life?) don't catch up to them.The movie is a lot of fun, and leaves little to be desired, although it fails when it comes to matching the depth and seriousness of other westerns when it comes to the plot, and may bore some viewers.Oh, and of course, it is missing the famous ""draw.""

filipemanuelneto,7,0,0,03-Feb-17," A good biographical film.
","This film tells the life of the last Chinese emperor, Pu Yi. Crowned as a baby, he lived a life of limitless luxury but was eventually expelled from his throne by the revolution of 1911. Imprisoned in his palace like a bird in a golden cage, he saw the decay of his country and the dramatic changes of Republican China from the inside of the Forbidden City. Expelled by the Communists years later, he spent a good part of his life trying to regain his throne, and the rest of it imprisoned in Chinese reeducation camps that transformed him into an ordinary man. There is undoubtedly a poetic beauty in the transformation of the main character, and the film can make us feel the changes in his personality, as well as the changes of his former empire. The film suggests several things about him and the imperial family that I do not know if they are truth, like the apparent lesbianism of one of the emperor's wives and their use of drugs. Bernardo Bertolucci is a director that I normally do not appreciate, but I recognize in this film many qualities. The actors did a very regular and interesting performance. John Lone was perfect in the role of the emperor, but even brighter was Peter O'Toole, in a role that, otherwise, with another actor, could be overly subdued. The film's set-ups are glamorous and go a long way toward creating a Hollywood-era epic movie feel.

","Overall I have to confess that in spite of its very high rating this movie didn't really strike a chord with me. It's partly the genre I suppose. I've just never been much into Westerns. Horses and gunfights and saloons have never been of much appeal. Beyond that, though, I simply didn't find the story here to be particularly interesting, nor did I find the movie to be as much fun as a lot of people think it is. I can't give a movie that I don't find interesting a particularly high rating or much of a positive endorsement. Having said all that, though, I do want to acknowledge that it's just my personal bias, and that there's a lot about this movie that I liked in spite of the fact that when it was all put together it didn't appeal to me that much. So, let me offer the positives.First I appreciated the honesty right off the top. There really was a ""Hole in the Wall Gang"" and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were real figures in the Old West as a part of it. The movie follows the basic outline of their life - early bank and train robberies, the escape to Bolivia and the relationship with Etta (Katharine Ross) are all based on reality. But the movie was honest. Instead of saying ""Based on actual events,"" I loved that the opening caption was ""Most of this is true"" - thus acknowledging dramatic licence in a way that most ""based on actual events"" movies don't do. I liked the pairing of Paul Newman (Butch) and Robert Redford (Sundance). They worked very well together and offered pretty good performances in the title roles. The movie did a good job of creating some tension as Butch and Sundance were being pursued by a mysterious posse. The question that kept being asked by Butch (""Who are these guys anyway?"") hung in the air quite well. There were a handful of amusing scenes - especially the train robberies involving Woodcock (George Furth) which I enjoyed. A sense of fun was also created by the use (only once, mind you) of the song ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head."" In one sense, that song seems totally out of sync with the movie, but the scene in which it was used, in which Butch takes Etta for a ride on a bicycle, was a silly, fun scene, and a silly, fun song fit that scene, if not the overall feel of the movie, quite well.But for as much as I liked all that, what I have to keep coming back to is that I just didn't really find the movie to be all that interesting. Just a personal opinion and reaction. Obviously most people disagree with me. (4/10)",Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969.csv

Worst of all, the script and the performances are lacklustre - by the time we find out who these people are we don't really care much about them. There are some good points though - nice visual effects by Richard Yuricich, great production design by Richard Bridgland, and having a little girl voice the Red Queen super-computer is an excellent touch. This film has an odd resemblance to John Carpenter's superior Ghosts Of Mars - zombies, amnesia, an airborne virus, thrash metal music and a finale set on a train - but unlike that movie it doesn't give its characters enough time to develop, and it borrows far too much from better pictures, particularly Aliens and Dawn Of The Dead.

","When you begin to critique a film, some thing of the script, the special effects, or the camera shots, but most think of the performance of the actors. The majority of the time the actors make or break the film. It is possible for famous actors to not do so well in films while unheard of actors may come to stardom with an uncharacteristic performance that blows the audience away. Ted Demme made a very important decision when making the film Blow by casting the lead role to Johnny Depp. Without this choice, it is very possible this film could have been a total bust instead of one so effective and engaging. Johnny Depp plays the protagonist in the film, George Jung. Depp is a very well known actor who has played many different roles in his lifetime, but seems the perfect fit for Jung. While Depp is more known for his less serious and comedic roles nowadays such as in the Pirates of the Caribbean series and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, most of the current generation does not know about his serious roles in films early in his career. His persona as an actor is known in many different ways because of his wide variety of character traits. From his witty sense of humor, to his charismatic personality, to his mysterious and perplexing behavior, Depp can play almost any role. In Blow he plays George Jung, an ambitious 18 year old who wants to get away form his poor working class upbringing in Massachusetts so he moves out to California to start new and ""conquer the world"". Throughout the movie, Jung is depicted as a very intelligent and determined individual who always appears to be trying to prove someone or something wrong. He very quickly takes over the drug empire on the West Coast and back home in the East Coast before he starts collaborating with the Colombian cartel. All along the way Depp uses his variety of traits and portrays an aspiring, yet very lazy young individual who uses his charisma and seriousness to get what he wants. As stated in the New York Times review of the film, ""Mr. Depp's sorrowful countenance is the still point at the center of ''Blow's'' swirling hyperactivity, and his witty, spare performance gives the picture a poignancy -- a depth of feeling"" (Scott 1). The strong character of Depp makes you question your morals as you begin to root for Jung and hope he does not get caught while he is illegally distributing drugs. As you start to support a man who is breaking the law, you realize you are doing so because you like George. You want to meet George. You want to be friends with George. Some may even want to be George. The audience feels sympathy for him because of his past and understands why he is doing what he is doing. It even breaks your heart in the end when he gets caught and sent to prison for life. Jung is the anti-hero of the film, the protagonist who lacks idealistic views and morality, yet is the main focus of the plot. Rolling Stone said: ""Depp is dynamite, showing how George is susceptible to temptation but also to feelings and pain. It's not every actor who could survive the series of wigs and ruinous fashions that mark George as Sixties hippie, Seventies drug lord and Eighties cocaine casualty."" (Travers 1) While jokes are made about the physical change in Depp's appearance with his numerous different hairstyles to match the culture of those decades, the main focus is how his character changes and adapts throughout the film based on his experiences. Depp starts Jung off as a quiet and underachieving kid from Massachusetts who gets a taste of the good life when he finds success dealing marijuana in California. Next, you slowly start to see Jung's character change as he starts operations back east and in Mexico. His success fuels his ambition and temptation, which as a result raises his ego and confidence. As George joins the big leagues and begins to work with the Colombian cartel in the cocaine industry, you finally see his character in full swing. At this point, he has turned into a psychotic drug dealer bent on making more money than he could even begin to imagine what to do with. He forgets about his family, his wife and daughter, and just wants to make money. Whether it be getting shot for not releasing information or defying the leader of the cartel, Pablo Escobar, George gets in many deadly situations which is something his character at the beginning of the movie never would have done. All along the way Depp is sensational in depicting these changes and as Peter Travers described in his review of the film, he is simply ""dynamite"". This movie demanded an outstanding actor to play the lead role, and Demme's choice of filling that role with Johnny Depp is ingenious. It would not have been the same if someone else were in his position. He fits the role perfectly, and as a result created an incredible film.",Blow 2001.csv

Tom Hooper manages to give a fantastic direction in the film, and the images and scenarios that he uses are impressive builds the film by every minute that passes. But the strongest point of the movie it really is the superb story. It's the biopic that tells the story of how King George VI (Colin Firth), the father of Queen Elizabeth II, overcame his stuttering problem. Being considered incapable by everyone except for his father to be king.George is reluctantly thrust to the throne after his brother David (Guy Pearce) is forced to abdicate. Overshadowed on the global stage by powerful orators like Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the King relies on the help of a little known Australian therapist, named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) to find his voice and boldly lead his people to mankind more devastating war has ever faced.The film manages to deliver a powerful, hilarious and poignant story, said against the backdrop of a critical moment in modern history. All thanks to the screenplay by David Seidler which is excellent. The British dry humor that David adds to the film's hilarious and fits perfectly in the movie. Placing an amazing reality on the characters, we see for the 1st time that the royal people are human beens like any other normal people with their own personal problems as anyone. Geoffrey Rush does a fantastic job, as well Helena Bonham Carter (as the wife of King George). But the shining star is Colin Firth, is EXCELLENT in every detail perfect giving a stutterer, and a very relatable character.The build up to the final climax is skillfully executed and led the audience to burst into applauds.

","The Girl Next Door is now a favorite movie in the teen genre.Initially I was going to rate this a 7 but there are great plot twists that sneak up on you just when you think you know where it is going; so in all fairness this movie gets the 8 for not standing idly in clichÃ© land.Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant gel nicely as the leads. There were many laugh out loud moments including the AVN convention and the prom, but the awards dinner was possibly the best (tie scene and dancing).While Emile and Elisha produce good chemistry and provide the plot foundation, it is the antagonistic relationship between Emile (Matt) and Timothy (Kelly) that keep you loving this movie. I could watch another movie based on these two alone.The supporting cast of nerd friends serve the film well and provide excellent comedic relief.On pondering what changes would make this movie rate as 9-10, I am still unsure because pushing the boundaries further might also push the movie too far across the absurdity line.

","This movie begins with some fishermen in the Meditterean Sea recovering a body they see floating in the water. When they pull the unconscious man (Matt Damon) aboard the boat they realize that he is alive and has two bullet holes in his back. After treating his wounds the man awakens but doesn't know who he is or any events from his past. Fortunately, one particular piece of evidence found upon him has an account number for a bank in Zurich which the man immediately proceeds to check out when he finally gets to shore. Upon opening the bank deposit box the man discovers several passports under different names, a large stack of money in various currencies and a gun. He takes everything but the gun and decides to use the name of ""Jason Bourne"" from the American passport. He then proceeds to the American embassy in Zurich and discovers that for some reason he is wanted by almost all of the law enforcement agencies in Europe and the United States. He also discovers that he is especially adept with guns and hand-to-hand combat. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that the overall story was acquired from a book (of the same title) which was written by Robert Ludlum and used in a previous mini-series in 1988 with Richard Chamberlain in the main role. Unlike the mini-series, however, this particular film has better action and more suspense which results in a slightly better movie in my opinion.

I would like to add one thing about how they wrapped it up at the end. I've always been a fan of the epic endings that tie the movie back together and reference something earlier in the movie then cuts to black (like Wolf of Wall Street, the ""sell me this pen"" which was referenced earlier and is the last line of the movie). In my opinion they should have had him teaching before they had him on the bench, and when he looks down and sees the plant growing and says ""hey there"" like he did earlier, that's where I thought they could have cut to black.

velvoofell,8,3,12,13-May-12," Maybe Not Slavishly Faithful - But Evocative of a Childhood with Monsters.
","'Dark Shadows' is a TV show I was never familiar with apart from when Tim Burton and John Waters name checked the 1960s American Gothic soap opera in their 1989 UK promotion of 'Beetlejuice' and 'Cry Baby' respectively. So, to me if no-one else, Burton seemed a natural to bring a condensed homage to the show to the big screen. Though having never seen the source material, I enjoyed Burton and Depp's 'Dark Shadows' as it evoked a childhood, much like my own, spent as an outsider even the Dungeons and Dragons crowd wouldn't have, let alone the football team - why throw a dice or obey a DM to become a monster when you could drape a sheet over yourself, bare your top set of teeth at bemused girls in the playground and be Christopher Lee, dive about a local forest on a BMX like Skywalker on a speeder bike or carry a plastic gun through a car park as if I was Shaft... OK maybe my parents should not have shown me a videotape of 'Shaft' at age 7.What 'Dark Shadows' central performance, Johnny Depp as Barnabus Collins, was a refined version of, was the remotely talented kid channelling a vampire in play. Eva Green's all powerful witch Angelique had something of the same quality and so a brilliantly staged, professional version of kids at play was infectiously delivered on screen.This sense of play from children of the nineteen seventies where the age of tweens truly took hold has been in other films. This was the personal, deep way films like 'Where the Wild Things Are' and 'The Muppets (2011)' were interpreted for the cinema. This is professional fan fiction writ large and with its heart on its sleeve. Depp may have been the very seven year old who aped Jonathan Frid's original Barnabus Collins while Burton may have been formed by the era of inventive exploitation movies and solid auteurs of horror. Kubrick's 'The Shining' is inferred at points in the opening exterior and intermediate interiors of the film while Donner's 'The Omen', Argento's 'Suspiria' and even 'The Godfather' are woven into the film's Proustian depiction of seventies life in a way, for example, JJ Abrams never quite recaptured the eighties in 'Super 8'. The music of the time doesn't just pervade the soundtrack - one representation of a werewolf is straight out of 'Ozzy Osbourne's 'Bark At the Moon' cover while a CGI-makeover-ed Alice Cooper struts iconically in one party scene and all but steals the show.The soap operatics insist that character arcs from five series of a late sixties, early seventies TV show are condensed into one film and this is fairly well handled. I bow to the opinion of disappointed fans as I would never want, say, a big screen 'the Prisoner' to cram the whole slow-burn plot into one film. However the summoning of 'Dallas' and not a little Hammer (there was after all a 'Dracula: AD 1972')is present.Overall a film to sate original fans of vampires, ghouls, witches and wolf-men who collected garish art cards and abandoned Aurora kits to swamps of glue.

He started his carer in 1963 as an animator and was involved in many early classics of Japanese animation. From the beginning, he command attention with his endless ideas for moviesIn 2004, Hayao Miyazaki along with Studio Ghibli, released his new project - Howl's Moving Castle. The plot is about a young insecure girl named Sophie who work in her fathers hat shop, different from her sisters. One day she is cursed by a witch who shapes her body as a 90-year-old woman. In order to undo the spell, Sophie run away from home and end finding the castle of wizard Howl Jenkins Pendragon.I watched this movie a long time ago when I was in my pre-adolescence and I decided to reveal it because every time it's a new experience. What I like about this movie is his simplicity, purity, and a feel of a real world - even if it's a totally fantastic world. It's like if the characters are from one emotion to another and we follow their development as people.Hayao does very well that very simple structure of his narrative. He knows exactly the right time to apresent each element to us. The moments that needs to be calm, those that needs action and the exciting ones. Also, being based in a book by Diana Wynne Jones we found common elements of fantasy story books. At first, we have the main characters: a girl who will go through a magic adventure and the wizard Howl who, at first, appears as a selfish prince as the ones in a Beauty and the Beast (1991). Then the antagonist who is the evil witch, the secondary characters who have charisma and help the main charactersHowever, having a lot of subtexts some ideas or messages can be confusing to understood. Like, for example, Howl's relationship with the witch or how Sophie manage to undo her spell over the course of the movie. At the same time Howl is handsome and powerful, he is cowardly and selfish. He is complex and in the movie this may not have been well explained why.But despite that it is a great animate film.

","North by Northwest (1959)Perhaps a perfect movie, and a perfectly Hitchcock movie. This has great sets (including a mock up copy of Mt. Rushmore and the real United Nations exterior, shot by stealth from a car). And it has three great performances from two great actors and an actress who rises to her best for this demanding role. This would be of course Cary Grant at his middle aged peak of handsome easy charm, James Mason at his middle aged peak of handsome easy charm (and very different), and Eva Marie Saint, nearly a decade after her searing appearance in ""On the Waterfront,"" very much a mature woman, alluring and yet knowing. You can see this is an adult film, by and for adults, including the very adult Hitchcock, who seems to be having the time of his life making it.The plot itself propels, scene to scene to scene, as if we are in on the chase, and yet it stops for some genuine laughs, hilarious moments snuck between the layers of cold war chill. That seems a contradiction, in a way, since this isn't at all a comedy, in the normal sense. And there are some sexual innuendos that were subtlety working around the fading Hays Code rules, and that now seem like pure brilliance. It's a smart, bubbly, entertaining mix.Some people don't get Hitchcock, and I get that. I love his films more and more over the years. ""North by Northwest"" is characteristic of his willingness, even his insistence, on keeping the artificial edges to the movie visible, the clearest example being the runaway car early in the movie, and the famous chase over our dead white presidents at the end. It's as stylish and entertaining as a movie can be, from the costumes (Grant's legendary grey suit and Saint's gorgeous dresses, picked up at Bergdorf's) to the interiors (not only the painted backdrop of the U.N. building but Grand Central, a couple of famous hotels, and a classic stuffy mansion).You can moan when Grant's character, Mr. Thornhill, grabs the knife out of the man's back, or you can notice the out of order backdrops out the window of the train (it moves from sunset to late evening to sunset, and the bridge appears and disappears in a blink). But that means you're in it for the wrong thing. (In the first case, you want him to grab the knife, because that's the classic mistake in thrillers. In the second, you're supposed to be watching Grant and Saint in one of the sexiest understated dialogs of all movies.)Yes, I like this film. It is, above all, likable. It's brilliant and all that, too, but when it comes to just enjoying watching a movie, this is top shelf.",North by Northwest 1959.csv

","'The Wolf of Wall Street' is the story of up and coming yuppie Jordan Belfort as he schemes his way to the top of the stock-broker game. It's safe to say, as entertaining as this movie seems, it really isn't.Martin Scorsese is a legend in the directing business, but he falls short this time with the absurdity of this film. In no way am I intolerant of a hard R-Rated film, but this pushed it to a disgusting and uncomfortable level. The word 'F#%k' is used in close to damn near every sentence to a grand total of over 500 times. Clearly the script writers had an easy job writing dialogue where 80% of it is profanity.In no way am I knowledgeable of the real Jordan Belfort, but DiCaprio's representation of him is way too exaggerated that it's borderline ridiculous. Even without reading the book, I'm 100% sure that the life of Jordan Belfort was in no way as bold-faced, wacky, exaggerated and goofy as it's represented in this film. DiCaprio does an okay job with his performance when it comes to the emotional and more direct scenes as Belfort, but it's buried under the crazy non-sense this film constantly bombards the audience with.Margot Robbie plays Jordan's second wife Naomi, who's only purpose is being the 'sex object' and estranged wife. A woman who marries a man who cheats on his ex-wife (with you), is a sex and drug addict that runs a scheming business, deserves every bad thing that happens. Jonah Hill, rounds off the cast as Belfort's.....goofy sidekick Donnie......and that's it.Scorsese fails on every level for a director of his capacity, making this film a huge miss for him. People are gonna like this film more than not, so DiCaprio will get an Oscar nomination for all the wrong reasons. This was a viewing experience that made me feel high on cocaine when it was over, but not in a good way. The film pushed itself and it's audience till it breaks with all the ridiculous profanity and erratic craziness that leaves you baffled and wondering: ""What the hell did I just see?""So if you get a chance to see this film, don't take it.",The Wolf of Wall Street 2013.csv

The escaping convicts meet hobos on the railways and encounter a Christian revival and are baptized along the way.

gengar843,9,6,18,22-Nov-07," From Lovecraft to Cloverfield
","EDITED REVIEW:Stephen King likes to pretend he doesn't believe in traditional religion but he obviously does. He just likes to rain on everyone's parade. Whether this is a personal cruelty or just a joke, it still comes off as crass and, frankly, forced.In THE MIST, a main character, Mrs. Carmody, a fundamentalist Christian living in Maine, of all places, preaches that what comes in the titular mist is vengeance from God. Stephen King makes it clear it certainly is. In fact, King is obviously angrier with misuse of technology than with misuse of the Bible. The end of Mrs. Carmody is savage in a way that appeases people who just want her to shut up, not really people who don't believe in God. What Mrs Carmody is saying is not truly out of the real of possibility, it's the way she says it. She's vulgar, curses a lot, and it seems obvious she is bipolar. This then is King's little joke, that you'd have to be literally mentally ill to be fervent. The next level down for King is fear. If you shiver for your life, you'll follow anyone. This many be true, but this is more a commentary on charismatic leaders than on religion. That Mrs. Carmody's message is at the right place and time to sway the shaken crowd isn't an indictment that she's looking for someone to lead, but rather that for the first time in her life her own faith seems to be showing itself. I don't see how anyone can fault Mrs. Carmody for that, but, like I said, she acts more like a demon than an angel, so it's not a great surprise that she gets hers.As for the character David Drayton, played by the great Thomas Jane, he is the antithesis of Mrs. Carmody. He begins with a sense of fairness, as when he helps his neighbor, Brent Norton, after the thunderstorm, and watches it dashed to pieces, as when Norton accuses Drayton of trying to make him look foolish rather than trying to save his life. Of course, the deepest fall for Drayton is at the end, when he commits the ultimate acts of faithlessness one minute too soon. We can talk about whether it was murder or assisted suicide, mercy or thoughtlessness, but there is no doubt that whatever faith in himself Drayton had disappears in that moment, and he now realizes he should've had faith in the Almighty to rescue him, even if not in Mrs. Carmody, who obviously was not going to save anyone. This brings up an interesting question: Did the people in the supermarket ultimately survive? If they did, was it not by the crazed and herself-murderous Mrs. Carmody that they did. Alas, we don't know. What we DO know is that the character played by Walking Dead alumnus Melissa McBride DID survive, and seemingly was rewarded for her own courage, if not faith. Speaking of Walking Dead, THE MIST is written/directed/produced by Frank Darabont, co-creator of that winning series, Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale Horvath on WD), and Laurie Holden (Andrea on WD), a veritable what-what!?.The beasts from THE MIST are Lovecraftian, and the premise is slight, that the military has released them into our dimension from another, through an unknown scientific process. THE MIST predates CLOVERFIELD by one year, but these monsters and their sounds seem awfully familiar. Is it possible the films take place in the same timeline universe? Watching them back-to-back, there is a feeling that CLOVERFIELD is a continuation, as perhaps beasts which escaped destruction in Maine, although CLOVERFIELD seems to indicate those might've come from another planet.The pace of this film is well-suited and there is little filler. The characters are briefly-delineated but sufficiently so. There is a feeling of anxiety but not rushed. The effects are well-done and the atmosphere is pretty great.9/10",The Mist 2007.csv

Zombies attacking and munching on people. Instead, WWZ gives the audience zombies running around at Mach speed and cut scenes at what should be interesting points.Pitt's character is wooden and unsympathetic. Even as an anti-hero, I didn't buy into the character. It's clear that Pitt and his wife/family are very close but does the audience need to be constantly remind of this? The story makes very little sense with Pitt traveling across the globe in search of answers. What makes matters worse, very little of the data gathered has an effect on the final outcome of the film.The South Korea airbase scene in particular adds no value to the story. Everyone is aware that they need to be extremely quiet to sneak onto a plane to leave. Pitt however, leave his phone on and receives a call from his wife at the worse possible moment and people become dead as a result. Pitt's character is supposed to be the best at what he does but yet fails to observe safety protocols? This makes no sense.The hoards of CGI created living dead are unconvincing and in some scenes, resemble the ones in ""I am Legend.""

Another film ruined with ""shaky cam"" filming .In a way, this movie parallels the 2011 film ""Contagion."" In fact, you can replace the Pitt investigative scenes with the ones from ""Contagion"" and have a more cohesive story.There is very little blood shown on screen.

I adore his character, and his lines were epic :)--Kristoff's conversations with Sven - I do that all the time with my pets, and it was awesome and laugh-out-loud hilarious to see it in a movie!The disappointing:--Hans. I mean, really?? I did not see that coming. I also did not like that twist.--Elsa being the ""I don't need a man"" kind of woman. I loved the direction it was going when there were two guys and two girls - each girl gets to be with someone who loves them, and are able to be sisters again.The bad:--Nothing!! I didn't find anything bad with this movie. It's awesome, and while I would have changed the ending, it's just a movie ;)Our Alternate Ending #1:Since Elsa is Winter, Anna is Summer. Elsa had knocked Anna's powers out when she hit her with the snowball as a little girl, and Anna gets her magic back when Kristoff takes her to see the trolls. Then, she's able to stop her sister's eternal winter, by bringing summer. The sisters then find that they need each other to be balanced, and are able to be best friends again. Elsa doesn't have to fear her powers, because she has her sister to thaw everything back out again.Anna is actually the true love of Hans, and he's not cold-hearted. Kristoff ends up being Elsa's true love, and both girls find themselves able to be close sisters again, while also each having their true loves. All 4 live happily ever after!Our Alternate Ending #2:Kristoff ends up being Anna's true love, and Hans ends up being Elsa's true love. Each guy balances their girl out: winter to summer and vice versa (think about it: blonds with red- heads...winters with summers). They all balance each other out, and with the help of her new love, Elsa is able to control her powers.Overall:This is definitely a movie I will be watching again and again, and will soon become part of our home collection, I'm sure.

The pauses between conversations, scenes where Goslings' character is looking out of a window, zooming in on his shadow, just add to the whole style of the movie.I think its a really hate it or love it affair, once you sat through a viewing you will either be feeling you saw the most immersing, beautiful film in years, or you will think of it as tedious & boring.If you belong to the latter, i have lost all hope in humanity.

If you have seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. The rest of the scenes are just (nice) fillers.But I just want to talk about the driving scenes, because they really destroyed the movie for me. How can you create an ambitious (love) story about a driver and then use such mediocre, de-energized and unrealistic driving scenes ?OPENING SCENE: I just liked the idea of using the stadium to disappear in the crowd. But apart from this there was nothing special and not much tension. Nothing you would remind, nothing which made you think ""wow"". Just compare this with the gripping opening scenes of ""Mad Max"", ""Heat"" or ""Point Break"". You still can remember them, right? Director Refn just failed to give ""Drive"" such an remarkable, powerful opener.PAWN SHOP SCENE: 1) How would you park your getaway car ? Towards the shop (so you have to do an u-turn) or towards the road you want to use to get away as quick as you can? 2) Our awesome driver can't outrun a Chrysler 300 with a Mustang GT on a winding road ? Hard to believe, even if the Chrysler is a SRT-8... 3 )You plan to rob a guy but you know he is an outstanding driver - would you try to catch him by car ?BEACH SCENE: 1) You can ram a car off the road, but avoid to also jump off the road with your own car? Come on... 2) You ram a car off the road and your headlights will still work? Detroit steel must be really tough... DUBBED ENGINE SOUND: The engine sounds are obviously dubbed and it's done in a really bad razzle-dazzle way: In the opening scene, you just hear the Impala revving up and shifting up very quickly - 2nd gear, 3rd gear, 4th gear, 5th gear. There is no way you will reach 5th or 6th gear in a urban car chase with packed streets. I guess it has just been dubbed to compensate a lack of tension and thrilling driving.While the inboard scenes, there is also no down-shifting noise, no release of the throttle to take a corner. Compare this with Steve McQueens inboard scenes in ""Bullitt"" and you'll understand how ridiculous the driving scenes in ""Drive"" are...I REALLY MISS... realistic, but thrilling car chases like in Bullitt, Vanishing Point, The French Connection,The Driver, Blues Brothers, What's up doc?, Christine and Death Proof. Unfortunately, this kind of old-school car chases seem to extinct for the sake of unrealistic crap for teens...",Drive 2011.csv

liberationz,9,6,29,05-Oct-15," Ridley Scott could be back.
","Has Ridley Scott finally returned to form with The Martian? Well seeing that The Martian turned out to be one of the best films of the year, you can say yes! After a period of mediocrity by Scott, The Martian was a reminder that Scott is one of the great directors living today. When you initially look at this film on paper, you see an amazing cast, good writer, and shaky director, but this film had it all. First of all it is amazing to look at. The cinematography is stellar, shot by Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Exodus: Gods and Kings, Alice in Wonderland). Ridley Scott's execution of this film was outstanding, he made you feel like they were actually on Mars. When you look at this cast, which has various Oscar nominated actors you are expecting the performances to be good (maybe not great cause look how the Counselor turned out), and they deliver big time! Matt Damon who played Mark Watney was obviously the star of the movie. He delivered on all aspects, and might be one of his best performances of his career. Jeff Daniels (Teddy Sanders) does an amazing job in this movie, playing a real human being, a business man who is concerned only about what is best for NASA. He is not the antagonist at all, even though he might be made out to seem like it. The whole crew consisting of Jessica Chastain (Melissa Lewis), Sebastian Stan (Chris Beck), Michael PeÃ±a (Rick Martinez), Kate Mara (Beth Johanssen), and Aksel Hennie (Alex Vogel) played off each other so wonderfully. It seems like they have been together for such a long time and the chemistry is beautiful. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Vincent Kapoor) was superb, but when is he not? Sean Bean was Sean Bean really, nothing super spectacular, but not bad. Kristen Wigg, leaving we can say her comfort zone in comedy and doing some drama, did well, didn't disappoint. Surprising performance came from Mackenzie Davis (Mindy Park) who blew me away. My least favorite was Donald Glover who seemed out of place in this movie and was one really slight negative, but did not detach me from the film. This movie is really an original piece, of human survival and hope. Ridley Scott managed to make this movie feel so real, you were scared for the well being of Matt Damon while he was stuck on Mars. The writing was outstanding as well, done by Drew Goddard. It was the perfect blend of comedy and suspense. The big things I was worried did not happen at all. Mainly being that the movie seemed to spoiled by the trailers, but it wasn't! Also the science behind it all which I thought could become confusing, wasn't! This film ended up being one of my favorite of the year, and made me remember what a great director Ridley Scott can be, and don't be surprised come Oscar time, you see The Martian in the running for an award. Highly recommended a must see this year.",The Martian 2015.csv
dredarin,10,2,10,20-Jan-05," A historical epic with just a tad of Hollywood glaze
","After seeing so many bad reviews of this movie, I was a bit nervous as I headed to the theater to see it. But I was determined to see it, both because critics are so often wrong, and because Alexander is my absolute favorite historical figure.Believe me, if they screwed up Alexander, I would be more unhappy than anyone! I was worried they would pull some cheap trick like Troy, massively altering the characters to make the story more Hollywood-friendly.I was VERY pleasantly surprised!!! I was completely engrossed in the movie for the entire 3 hours! I was so into the movie, I would have gladly sat through another hour or two! I liked the way they used Ptolemy narrating to condense the story into the time span of a 3 hours movie. It was an excellent idea. Granted, I would've liked to see a lot of the part flushed out more, but the movie was already at the maximum length that American movies ever seen to hit. I'm hoping for an extended version on DVD, or at least a lot of deleted scenes! All the actors were fantastic! I really got into every character. I hardly noted these supposed ""accent problems"" that were so ragged upon by critics.The best part of the movie was the stunning chemistry between Colin Farrel and Jared Leto. In the end, I agreed with Stone's artistic choice to never show them together in a love scene, or even kissing. It really emphasized the true love and bond between them. There was so much between their two characters that you could just feel it when they looked at each other.I absolutely loved this movie! I haven't seen a movie of this caliber since ""Interview with the Vampire"" or ""Dragonheart"". Fantastic epics are so rare in the cheesy popcorn world of modern movies! I plan on buys this movie on DVD the second it comes out, and, hopefully, catching it a few more times in second run theaters. I highly recommend it! However, I would advise becoming basically familiar with the story of Alexander the Great before seeing the movie; that way, you won't have to worry about figuring out the historical elements and can just sit back and enjoy this masterpiece.",Alexander 2004.csv
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,6,1,1,30-Dec-09," He does return, and he brings nothing new with him
","More of the same. For anyone wondering, no, I don't like Indiana Jones either(though I've barely watched any; I do believe that I'd enjoy it, and I can't say that for this). You know, I really wish I could say something nice about Sommers. No, honestly. For as cathartic as it can be to unleash a verbal smack-down in these reviews, it is nothing compared to how satisfying it is to point to what a certain film-maker does that sets them apart from the rest. Be it an uncompromising vision, perfectionism, or, heck, simpler things such as them always making the viewer laugh, or being dependable to provide exciting pictures. But I can find no such thing about him. Well, to be accurate, nothing that is *positive*. The numerous holes that this(the *second flick*) creates in the continuity are one of the signs that he expects the audience to just ignore all of the inconsistencies, to not question the fiction we are served. While there are a couple of things that are kinda cool, and the occasional second here and there of the non-stop action that doesn't suck, everything is still ridiculously over the top. Can he please limit his crap to focusing on only one catastrophe at a time? The effects continue to be the real attraction(and they're already outdated), albeit this has less of people standing around to admire the aesthetic value of the source of the immediate danger that they are in. I don't know why they chose to cut corners with several of the FX, instead of figuring out a different way to do the sequence(it would be less obvious). Bits in this mirror the first, only here, it makes even less sense. Rick himself has a line about how convenient the plot is. Every character is obnoxious, and this adds an intolerable kid. I repeat the question: Who are we meant to care about? Emotion is invariably phoned in, mainly because of the tone. A handful of these performers can act, elsewhere... it is not a myth, I have seen it. A couple of them may make an effort here. Oded Fehr remains my favorite thing about these. The Rock has so little to do that you can barely be disappointed; it is worth noting, however, that, in this, his face often seems to indicate that the desert exudes an incredibly rank odor. Oh, wait, sorry... that's him trying to look bad-ass. This is powerfully unfunny, and a few moments are disgusting. When did Imhotep develop outright telekinesis? And why on Earth does he only use it sometimes? There is mild, if potentially disturbing, violence in this. Well, the mummies do, to an extent and every now and again, actually have the appearance they're supposed to. And this provides hot chicks(including showing them briefly half-naked) for us straight males to gawk at. I mean, I've never noticed before that Weisz is that sexy. Maybe this is the only time she's had cleavage so much in the space of two hours, and her legs featured prominently in as frequent shots as here. In ways(not all), this is not as awful as the original. I recommend this to any fans of that, and/or of cheesy adventure movies in general. 6/10",The Mummy Returns 2001.csv

This movie also left me very confused in the end, they hardly explained why the alien machines collapsed except that it had something to do with single celled organisms. This movie would have been much better if they explained the alien race we were fighting a bit more. Showing chilling digitally made images of a much further advanced alien society inhabiting a horribly polluted planet marching around in lines would have been very appropriate.

crculver,5,3,7,21-Jul-15," What might have been an epic film was cut until it lacks cohesion, and the hammy ensemble cast doesn't help
","The circumstances around Terence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE are sometimes more talked about than the film itself. The reclusive director had made a big splash in the Seventies, but there followed two decades of silence. When he finally reappeared in 1998 to direct this adaptation of James Jones's novel about the Battle of Guadalcanal in World War II, many actors were desperate to work with him and he was able to gather a large ensemble cast. He shot over five hours of footage but had to cut it down to three, leaving out many actors entirely from the finished version.THE THIN RED LINE tells of the American battle against Japanese forces on the island from the landing on its beach to the time the initial troops are relieved and sail off for some new, unknown deployment. But it actually begins shortly before this when Private Witt (Jim Caviezel), who has been AWOL and living with the local Melanesian people on a nearby island, is discovered by a patrol and brought in before his sergeant. The battle itself involves the men of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division: besides Caviezel as Witt, major roles are played by Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, Adrien Brody and Ben Chaplin. Elias Koteas is Capt. Staros, who tries to look out for his men, while a hyperbolic Nick Nolte plays their commander who sees the infantry as nothing but cannon fodder to wrecklessly throw at the Japanese.For most of its 3-hour length, the men are torn apart by Japanese machine gun fire as they try to take a hill, but the enemy is never directly seen. Between scenes of great violence, there are portentous voiceovers by various characters as they meditate on what war says about the larger human drama. Eventually US forces are able to overcome Japanese positions, and the Japanese side of the offensive is depicted with more fairness and equanimity than in most American films on the Pacific Theatre of the war.While the realistic depiction of battle might touch viewers -- and it's hard to knock any World War II film since they spur one to read more about this crucial event in history, this is not a great film. It has obviously been cut heavily from its original length. John C. Reilly appears several times at the centre of shots, clearly meant to be a major character, but most of his scenes and all of his back story were cut. The philosophic voiceovers come across as pretentious instead of insightful. Furthermore, I find this a very ""Hollywood"" film, with the acting often exaggerated. Woody Harrelson doesn't play a WWII grunt, he plays Woody Harrelson. George Clooney appears at the end and all realism goes out the window: there's no way this suave, handsome leading man has been fighting a war for some time now. Hans Zimmer's musical score too obviously pulls the audience towards prescribed emotions.",The Thin Red Line 1998.csv

classicalsteve,10,1,2,22-Oct-07," Best Film About the Horrors of War--A Lesson We Still Need to Learn
","For about 20 years, from roughly 1950 to 1970, war films were largely about selfless heroes, often depicting World War II soldiers whose morality would make the likes of Gandhi or St. Francis of Assis proud. By the 1970's, film rhetoric about war began to shift to another angle. By the time of the release of Platoon, films began painting an altogether different portrait of the war experience from the perspective of the private on the ground rather than from a general or colonel. ""Platoon"" never depicts high-ranking officers discussing tactical plans in an administrative room or racing around in jeeps, saluting the troops. This is war at the ground level where the battles are fought and people suffer and die, regardless of the cause and the winners. From the perspective of ""Platoon"", nobody ""wins"".Although war brings out heroism, it more often brings out the worst because the stakes are so terribly high. War is rarely about heroes; it is about survival at all costs which can incite much immoral behavior. More often, soldiers will hide the truth, debase themselves in front of superiors, unjustly blame inferiors, exploit circumstances for advancement, and kill without provocation. These behaviors are true as much among officers as enlisted men, and these are the realities that Oliver Stone, the director and writer of ""Platoon"", explores instead of the glossy triumphs of other films. And this is a world he knows intimately because Platoon is a semi-autobiographical account of his experience in Vietnam.Aside from being one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen, ""Platoon"" is about finding meaning in a situation that appears to be about nothing more than senseless violence, destruction, and killing. But that meaning is not equated with the moral metaphors of earlier Hollywood offerings whose canvas depicted the good guys and the bad guys in very distinct colors. Here, everything is blurred from the American soldiers to the misty jungles of South Vietnam. Only the poor villagers who have been caught in the gunfire are truly innocent, and they are the ones who pay the highest price. The landscape is populated with the scar-ridden Barnes (Tom Berenger), who regards the war as a personal proving ground, Elias (Willem Dafoe), the lone moral voice of the platoon who comes into conflict with Barnes, Lt. Wolfe (Mark Moses), probably an ROTC graduate whose sum total of war experience is marching around college sophomores at the Ohio University campus, Sgt O'Neil (John McGinley), a hot-headed flip-flopper when it comes to loyalty, and Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), who joins the platoon out of civic duty. But after about 20 minutes, Taylor realizes that no one has a sense of duty on this playing field.The strength of ""Platoon"" is how real and devastating it all seems. The audience feels like they are walking along side these men and experiencing the war with them. And unlike most action movies, which build toward climatic sequences, the moments of combat explode from nowhere, often during a subdued moment, which is probably closer to the real experience of engagement. One of the most frightening moments is when Charlie Sheen, just relieved from guard duty late in the night, sees in the distance a group of enemy combatants combing the foliage for potential prey. We see the enemy from Sheen's point of view, silently moving through the shrubbery like evil specters. Neither Dracula nor Frankenstein were ever this terrifying. The private who relieved Sheen of guard duty has fallen asleep, putting Sheen in a precarious predicament. He can neither make a move for his gun which is just out of arm's reach or call to his fellow soldiers lest risk being a target of enemy gunfire. What can he do?One other scene I found particularly convincing is a moment late in the film when Sgt O'Neil played with brilliant angst by John McGinley asks for a furlough from Sgt Barnes, played with subtle wicked believability by Tom Berenger. When Berenger denies the request, McGinley becomes emotional, letting his inner fears of their coming confrontation out into the open. I believe that McGinley's performance is one of the best I have yet seen in terms of accurately portraying a soldier's dread of combat. For a moment, I forgot I was watching a movie and thought I was in Vietnam.These are the kinds of dilemmas that permeate throughout ""Platoon"": no win situations in which everybody loses, regardless of the outcome. Unlike the war films of the heyday of the studio system that featured the likes of John Wayne propagating how heroic the Americans were in the cause of the allied forces in World War II, the message of Platoon is far less romantic but many times more profound. War is hell, and the message is to tell others the story of this hell to prevent its recurrence in the future. In short, war should be prevented at all costs. It has probably been a profound shock to the filmmakers that this simple message was disregarded 20 years after the release of this film. We are still a country that has not quite learned the lessons of Vietnam.",Platoon 1986.csv
radoii_87,8,2,3,05-Feb-14," Lack of control...
","Modern film noir is about control, more specifically, the lack of control. The characters are often emerged in a world where they do not seem to have control over their fate. Most of the time, they live in a ""corrupt"" world where twisted constructs or demented minds pull the strings(e.g. east coast mob, Hollywood). Those ""villains"", instead of being completely revealed and described, are only hinted throughout the story. Yet, the focus is indirectly on them because of how they affect the characters. To emphasize this, the writers often look only at a snapshot of the characters' lives and reduce the dialogue to a minimum (e.g. Ryan Gosling's character is not given a name or a past that can potentially explain some of his actions). ""Drive"" successfully touches on most of the typical characteristics of the genre. However, a relatively new aspect is built in as well. Carey's character is not a part of the ""world"", she is an outsider, thus, pure. She drives the change at the ""end"" when the driver leaves the scene and only the stuntman remains. The fact that the narrative is not sequential hints that the end result is outside of our control. In the ""outer reality"", we are the subjects and the writer is the puppet master.The story is delivered well here. The movie engages and works because of a young talented crew that feeds of each other and trusts each other.4/5 - Worth a watch",Drive 2011.csv

The English way?! Wasn't that colonialism? The actual story involves some college students in 1920's England who want to race in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. Among the characters are Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a Jewish student who has to face anti-Semitism, and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a Scottish Presbyterian who won't run on the Sabbath. Honestly, why must these things always come up in sports movies? That said, the movie wasn't a total waste. The theme song, which you've surely heard, has often been used in movies, best of all in ""National Lampoon's Vacation"".

","It seems all that Bruckheimer is doing nowadays is copying all his old movies, renaming a few characters and plot elements here and there, and re-releasing the movie under a different name. This time, he's moulding the underrated Prince of Persia video game franchise (a classic game franchise BTW) into his stock Pirates of the Caribbean script.The plot is your standard early-90s video game plot. Orphan boy (Gylenhaal) becomes King Sharaman's (Pickup) prince, much to the dismay of the King's brother (Kingsley). Kingsley, intent on seizing power, seeks to retrieve ""plot device"" from guardian, the guardian in this being a hot, young Princess (Arterton). Prince becomes attracted to Princess and sends Prince on a mission to retrieve said ""plot device"" by venturing across Persia (which seems to translate to Middle Earth). In this case, the plot device is a crude time machine that's shaped like a dagger (I wonder how much Bruckheimer wasted on the prop department for that?)This film is litigiously similar to the first Pirates of the Caribbean. The characters are the same, the story is the same, the fights are the same (only the clothes are different in this movie). This film's Sparrow is played by Molina, this film's Bo'sun is played by Toussaint, Gylenhaal and Arterton obviously transpose Bloom and Knightley, the three-Sparrows scene is now an ostrich race.

This is where Bruckheimer's strength lies, his wide assortment of likable characters filled with humour and chemistry (albeit a little gimmicky), and he places them in enjoyable adventure scenes which thrill and make you laugh.Hampering the movie is what hampers all of Bruckheimer's recent work. He has no clue on how to glue his plot ideas into a coherent storyline. Remember Sparrow repeatedly siding with Norrington then double crossing him in Pirates? This film is so packed with such double crosses / betrayals / alliances with the enemy that by its halfway, you have no idea who is the good guy and who is the bad. But who cares as long as there is sword fighting going on? (A: all non-Bruckheimer fans) The effect these double crosses have on the plot makes it so convoluted, that you might as well give up on the story by the time they reach the Mount Doom scene. Bruckheimer tries to make up for it by having plot dumps every 10 minutes (exacerbating the plot convolution), but he now has to reduce the segway scenes to a single panorama, then the 3-5 minute scene (lots of scenes don't help the convoluted plot).Bruckheimer needs to learn to cull his films more. If a scene is making the plot convoluted, you should cut it, not try to fit it in between two scenes which break the continuity. Not every scene has to make it into the final movie. You'll also make the movie shorter (quite important because Bruckheimer films are among the longest).Another convoluted film which will entertain Bruckheimer fans, and fill his bank account again.",Prince of Persia_ The Sands of Time 2010.csv
d_art,8,7,12,19-May-10," Not the usual kind of sequel
","In Iron Man 2, Robert Downey Jr. returns as billionaire Tony Stark, this time facing pressures from the government to share his armor technology with the military. At the same time, he discovers the technology which keeps him alive is also slowly killing him. He appoints Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as CEO of Stark Industries, while her old job goes to Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson). Meanwhile, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), the son of his father's enemy, joins forces with Stark's rival competitor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell).First off, I enjoyed the first Iron Man, but I wasn't a huge fan. I felt Jon Favreau's direction and Robert Downey Jr. made the film better than what it could've been. Tony Stark was fun, story was okay, and the villain was a bit disappointing. The idea of the villain being just another version of the protagonist never appealed to me. I felt the same way about the wannabe-Hulk villain in Incredible Hulk. Now, if the villain is very different from the hero (Joker vs. Batman / Superman vs. Lex Luthor / Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock), the hero has to apply different strategies, which makes for more entertaining battles. Well, in the Iron Man sequel, that idea hasn't changed too muchâ€”Iron Man still battles a similar foe, although there are now more of them. Thankfully, the shootouts, the flights, the computerized special effects, and the mass destruction are a lot of fun to watch, but it is not the central focus.This film's focus is all about the characters, an unusual direction for a sequel. It's no Transformers 2, that's for sure. Majority of the time, you won't see Tony Stark in armor. You do, however, get to see a bit of a darker and a vulnerable side to Tony, which happens to make him more complex, engaging, and sometimes, dangerous. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony flawlessly, and he's just as much fun, if not more, than before. Some may be put off by the dialogue-driven first half of the film. The film isn't all about ""let's hurry up and get him to fight somebody."" In fact, it takes its time, and there's not a whole lot of action in the beginning, but there's a certain build-up that leads to the eventual confrontation with the baddies. The film isn't so much about a specific villain or a goal, but it is mainly about Tony, his psychology, and his reactions to life. Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Pottsâ€”she is as we remember her from the last filmâ€”charming and continuously getting Stark out of trouble.Many interesting side characters make an appearance this time around. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) plays more of a prominent role as the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D. Scarlett Johansson has great screen presence as Natalie Rushman (aka. Black Widow)â€”she holds herself pretty well in a great martial arts scene. Don Cheadle has replaced Terrance Howard as Lt. Col. ""Rhodey"" and gets to play a more prominent role as an Iron Man suit-armored partner to Tony. This film, unlike the first film, tends to lean towards the idea of teamwork more. (Perhaps they're just prepping us for an Avenger film?) Mickie Rourke is engaging on screen as the Russian physicist villain Ivan, which he plays with dark relish. Although his technologyâ€”glowing, electrically charged whipsâ€”isn't anything new, he is always fun to watch. Likewise, Sam Rockwell is great as usual as a villain, the wisecracking Justin Hammer.The plot simply continues on from the last film, after people have found out the true identity of Iron Man. While it's nothing too complex, the progression of the story is logical--it would surely bring some enemies out of the woodwork if they knew who he was. The film's pacing isn't as zippy as the first film, where something always seems to be happening, and some audiences may be disappointed as a result.Overall, I found Iron Man 2 to be entertaining and a worthy sequel, and just different enough not to feel tacked on like an add-on to the previous film. Many sequels can get lazyâ€”they just throw in everything and make it bigger and louder. Some sequels simply let the story progress. This is that kind of sequel. I give Iron Man 2 *** out of **** stars.You can also follow my reviews on http://twitter.com/d_art",Iron Man 2 2010.csv

There are a few scenes where people self sacrifice and I love it. If it's done well and has a purpose. One of the mains gives up his life to hold a door. Cool! makes sense. We all liked that guy now we're sad. 
Then for no reason at all one of the old ladies just hangs out staring at her friend and gets attacked. Umm what?
Want even more dumb? The lady who watches her friend die is like hmmm I wanna die or something. Not really clear but opens up a door to let in a horde of zombies. Why? Who knows. Do you care? Not really. 
A sports guy running with the sports girl go into a train and after spending the whole movie keeping train doors closed behind them, you know: cause zombies, they don't and she gets attacked because jerk guy is alive and screws then over so sports guy could leave since everyone has died and turned and he's like nah let's hug it out. She eats him. 
The rest becomes a tense struggle for survival as the train conductor leaves the train for some reason to help jerk guy. Not sure what his plan was. No weapon and obviously no fighting ability so -dead 
then the ending is so dumb that it boggles my mind someone was like ""green light this baby."" Have the main character fight off jerk guy, who's in the process of changing but wait until he goes full zombie instead of kicking him in the crotch and throwing him off the train. So his solution: oh man you're gonna love this, he comes behind jerk and can grab him anywhere: feet, stomach, arms but no shoves his hand right in his mouth. Because yummy. So he's dead and could have been a reason other than to kill off the cast a few days into shooting for eating into the budget

","Though there are some fine performances (especially from Ben Chaplin), I found this film rather boring and very manipulative.  It is sad to say that with all the death in this film, the most wrenching moment for me was when Chaplin's character answered mail call.  His and Koteas' characters were the only ones I cared about. I did like the use of the different narratives, but c'mon...did everyone who fought (and whose minds we were allowed to enter) have a Texan or southern drawl?  Sometimes, it was difficult to distinguish between the actor's voices during narratives. Personally, I don't like a film that doesn't give me a sense of space. During battle scenes, I wasn't sure who was who and where everyone was. This can add to the feeling of what it is like to really fight in a war, but, to me (a simple viewer) it was only an annoyance.I also don't respond well to films which are obviously trying to convey messages, as this film did in its war/nature/death themes.  Flashing to images of nature destroyed, nature beautiful in moments of chaos....the filmmakers tried too hard.  It was overkill. Characters also seemed to ""get lost"" during the film.  A character would be in a scene, have a dramatic moment, then I wouldn't see him again until 20 minutes (just an estimate) later.  That's why I didn't care for many characters...I didn't get time to know them, even though I was in some of their heads!

The story could have been riveting, but somehow, it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to draw in this audience.Beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not, try as I might, involve myself in this story. As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected to *love* this flick - and yet, it left me cold.It could be a failing within myself, but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow, they lost me. It's a shame, because it could have been wonderful.Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. It wasn't.

sddavis63,8,3,6,19-Jan-08," A Pretty Decent Update of the Story
","It's been a long while since I either watched the original movie by the same name or read HG Wells' novel, on which both movies are based, but my memory tells me that Steven Spielberg did a pretty decent job of updating the story for a modern audience, while at the same time keeping the essential elements of Wells' story intact. The updates are necessary to make the movie relevant to the modern era. The basic change is that Wells story begins with radio reports of explosions being observed on Mars. This movie features television reports of strange, electromagnetic weather disturbances - a necessary change since (a) radio is no longer the medium through which we get news, and (b) we now know too much about Mars for the explosions to be believable. In another bow to the modern context, there are also some shades of 9/11. The kids think the alien attack at first is a terrorist act, and watching the dazed people walking by posters of the missing brought back memories of that terrible day.Within the movie itself, there was sustained action right from the beginning, a pretty good flow to the story and generally good performances. Tom Cruise was good as Ray Ferrier, a divorced father who has to protect his children once the aliens begin their attack. I say Cruise was ""good"" only because that's my general reaction to his work. He always seems to handle his parts well, but there's just some intangible quality about him that prevents me from going any better than ""good."" In this movie, frankly speaking, his performance is not as good as Dakota Fanning's was as Ray's daughter Rachel. She nailed the part, I thought - showing exactly what I think would be the quickly rising level of terror a young child in such circumstances would experience. She is completely believable. I must say that I never really connected with the character of Robbie - Rachel's older brother, played by Justin Chatwin. I had trouble figuring out exactly where his character was coming from.After so much action, the end of the movie is a bit anti-climactic, but so is Wells' story (and deliberately so.) The point of the rather sudden and understated ending is the irony involved in it - for all our military and technical prowess, it turns out to be something that we usually try to eradicate that saves us. On the subject of military prowess, one thing I found passing strange is that in putting this into a 21st century context, Spielberg didn't portray the military using nuclear weapons against the alien invaders which to me, given the desperate circumstances, would have seemed reasonable.All in all, though, this is a very well done movie and well worth watching. 8/10",War of the Worlds 2005.csv
Canino-4,10,0,0,21-Dec-00," The movie that became itself
","In writing this review, I'm tempted to address it to Don Hewitt and Mike Wallace. The Insider is a devastating film, but I think they are mistaken, if they see it as a blanket indictment of 60 Minutes. It's a blanket indictment of the tobacco industry. I don't think we will ever get to the bottom of what went on at 60 Minutes, with respect to the treatment of the Jeffrey Wigand interview. This movie is a dramatic piece that takes a stab at it, and I think that heaping criticism on Director/Writer Michael Mann is a huge mistake. This film shouldn't be picked at, it should be applauded. The spirit of this film is exactly the same as that of 60 Minutes. I doubt that most people watch 60 Minutes with a notepad in their hands. I think 60 Minutes gets people to think, and hopefully look into issues that are important. I believe that was Michael Mann's goal.The first issue to tackle is the presentation of Lowell Bergman, former producer at 60 Minutes, as the white knight of the story. There were complaints that Bergman got credit for things he didn't do, and that he didn't quit when they said he did, etc. I'm reminded of the avalanche of criticism that Oliver Stone received when he chose Jim Garrison as his vehicle to probe the JFK assassination. As Michael Kinsley noted at the time, critics assailed Stone for making a hero of Garrison, whom many considered a shameless self-promoter and a man of shaky morals, at best. While this attack was taking place, across the multiplex you could go see Warren Beatty and Writer James Toback's near deification of Benjamin Siegel in Bugsy. I'm tempted to say that it's Michael Mann's dime, so he can pick whatever hero he likes. However, I think the truth is that there was a wealth of information he needed to convey, and selecting Bergman as his vehicle was the best way to go.The second issue which had supposedly ""independent"" viewers up in arms was the aura of suspicion, manufactured or otherwise, that surrounded Jeffrey Wigand. This man will probably remain an eternal enigma. Was he exaggerating his claim of being harassed for some hidden agenda? Did he lie about finding a bullet in his mailbox? Did he try to cover up that he stole an electric can-opener?This second issue is at the core of my argument in defense of this film. Question: Isn't it more important that Wigand, a scientist who worked for Brown & Williamson, provided undisputed testimony that nicotine was being manipulated to bolster it's addictive qualities, than whether or not he stole an appliance at Walmart? Shouldn't people be more disgusted by the laughable testimony to congress by the seven heads of big tobacco (The Seven Dwarves, as he refers to them)?This movie became itself. It's a story of how many forces there are out in the world that seek to silence agitators. The simple truth is that Wigand, Wallace and Bergman had a story to tell and were crushed by some of these forces. Mann and Co-Writer Eric Roth wanted to tell this story on as big a screen as possible, and they got crushed, too. I'm surprised we didn't hear about how Michael Mann stole some lawn darts when he was in high school, or that Roth missed a Alfa-Romeo payment when he was in college. I hope this irony is not lost on Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt.It's no surprise that this film (vastly superior to the diverting, but hardly earthshaking American Beauty) was shut out at the Oscars. Kevin Spacey is one of our finest actors, but his character is not in the league of Russell Crowe's work here. Crowe's Wigand, with his birdlike and occasionally irritating behavior, with his egotism, with his intelligence, whoa! This is a performance. Reporters once again had a little fun when it was reported that Crowe didn't invite the real Wigand to the premiere. I guess this Crowe guy must be a schnook. Don't give him the Oscar.Truth be told, acting kudos go to all involved. Pacino, as Bergman, creates a stubborn character, who's not ashamed of his liberal nature, even when he's in a sea of conservatives. Christopher Plummer's controversial characterization is a delight as well. He gets Wallace's legendary tempestuousness, his egotism and his smarts down to perfection. The small characters are drawn with a sharp eye, as well. Alert to reporters: Mann's wife Diane Venora plays Wigand's wife. Bad news, though, she's a wonderful actress, and she's great here. Sorry.As the settlements from big tobacco come down, Mann's working on a film about about Ali, Bergman's back working in Berkeley where he belongs, Wigand is up to God knows what, and 60 Minutes chugs on, popular as ever.

""The Polar Express"" is an immensely exciting entry into the genre. I watched the film in 2D/HD and it was a true visual spectacle. The action sequences and train shots stood out as some of the best visual animation I've seen to date.It's going to be hard for many purists to take what I'm about to say. It won't help the ""who found this helpful"" percentage, but frankly I don't care - it's calling it how I see it.I watched Hugo a couple of weeks ago at the theater, and I truly believe that the Polar Express is as good or better. Where Hugo lacks in charm and adventure - The Polar Express excels. Where Hugo over-stays its' welcome - TPE tells a quick, basic fantasy storyline with no hidden agendas and no bows to anyone EXCEPT the audience.This film wasn't made for critics - it was tailor-made for someone like me - someone looking for a new Christmas classic to watch during the Holiday season. The first in a long-time, to line-up and put next to ""Miracle on 34th St."", ""A Christmas Story"", ""Rudolph The Red-nose Reindeer"", and others.The visual details during certain train sequences are jaw-dropping. Some people have talked about the ""eyes"" of the characters. It's not perfect, but it is the most realistic attempt at a human face that I've seen in animation. For that reason, it is going to be criticized. You can compare it say to any Pixar film, and the pixar films(like all animated films save this one) still show the old-fashioned human animated face-shapes, that succumb to conventionality instead of innovation. The Polar Express may have bitten off more than it could chew in this aspect, but I don't think it took anything away from the movie. Besides, the rest of the film is as visually spectacular as ANYTHING FROM PIXAR or any other production company - that includes modern marvels like Tekkon Kinkreet, to timeless classics like Fantasia and Snow White. Visually, this animation doesn't take a back-seat to anything.So the story had to fall short, right? Maybe a little. It's a Christmas fantasy. The storyline isn't anymore complex than any other film in this genre. It's about the heart of Christmas, and all the joys of the holiday. Every Christmas storyline(save Christmas Story) falls short. I wasn't looking for a deep storyline when I hit play. I was looking for something that embodied the spirit of Christmas. I got that and more.Catch this if you've put it off like me.80/100 I never like to say to people that they didn't ""Get"" a movie, or ""understand"" a movie. People take offense. But, this film does have some neat little concepts and nuances that could be over-looked by some.

","From the unique setting to the unsettling lullaby-like score, there really is nothing else quite like this masterwork of suspense, dread and suspicion. Director Roman Polanski's meticulous attention to detail pays off grandly here as usual, with each frame filled with striking elements, from the skyline of New York City to the peculiar sound mixing to a majestic apartment where most of the movie takes place. The story itself slowly unfurls and becomes gradually more suspenseful and portentous as it goes along, with Mia Farrow delivering a knockout of a performance as the naive but resilient Rosemary. She's aided greatly by an Oscar-winning performance by Ruth Gordon, who makes quite an impression here as a nosy neighbor who may be part of a witch's coven. On top of all its great elements, ""Rosemary's Baby"" also functions as a remarkably faithful adaptation of Ira Levin's 1967 novel, arriving nearly intact on the big screen.",Rosemary's Baby 1968.csv

herrbigbadwolf,10,90,114,27-Jun-07," This movie...it's a poem about a poet...
","...a song about a singer.I adore it. Nothing else is there to be said, really. The acting, all round, is sensational, but the lead, Marion Cotillard's portrayal of Edith Piaf, is beyond words. More astonishing even, I'd dare to say, than what Bruno Ganz did with Adolf Hitler in Der Untergang (although Ganz had only a mass murderer and historical criminal to work with, while Cotillard was dealing with, pardon me for saying, the soul of an entire nation).I would like to comment on the script. The little symbolic moments, full of grief, full of such a profound sadness...I have never seen this done so well. Certain elements of the story, a conversation or object, are only within the lasting of the film transformed from everyday, mundane stuff into everlasting symbols of affection, of redemption and personal torment.You see, this is the strong point of the film - it tries to(and often it manages) make you cry because of her tough life, but at the end you are crying because of the good things that happened to her. They too, are over: Edith never even regrets the bad ones.The music is a whole story on its own. I've loved Piaf for some years now, but, alas, I don't speak French, and now, at last, I have some context to place the songs into...and it breaks me. It really does.I saw the movie yesterday, went home, and listened to Edith's albums for hours, and they meant so much...they spoke volumes.Anyway, the direction is perfect, although there is one scene towards the end which has problems - it tells, for the very first time, of a rather important event in the much earlier years of the singer's life , and the event in question seems to be out of place, sort of neglected - as if it should have been dealt with an hour earlier. But this is only one tiny scene, and even it, in itself, is masterfully done. Everything else is flawless.The cuts and the singing are blended brilliantly together. I was especially struck, which is strange, by the end credits: they are very unusual and touching for a movie which is this musical (find out why!).Anyway, my deepest recommendations. See it, it is really excellent. It is dark and human and bright, and full of spectacular music.It is the 20th century.I fell in love with it.You might too.",La Vie En Rose 2007.csv

","I imagine this film will make a killing in the first week of release, especially the first weekend, then the word of mouth will get around and the box office will plunge. Which is okay by me. Granted there are some impressive visual moments in the film such as the ferry attack, the plane crash, and similar ones which are due to special effects, and then there are sort of interesting parts where due to editing and Spielberg's ""I'm a director"" you might pause at, say the murder in the cellar, or all the shots of reflections. But humanwise, characterwise, I frequently found myself saying, ""This sucks."" Why would I be interested in these people, they are unpleasant to be around. The hunting for goofs may be a trivial pursuit but it can be more satisfying than this film was in total. So...I could sort of overlook that Tom Cruise's character doesn't know his daughter has been allergic to peanuts, ""since birth"". It goes with the unappealing nature of his character, but why would the home where the mother and daughter now live even have a jar of peanut butter around?

RagingDraugr,7,1,1,05-Nov-18," Not great, but good.
","In The Name Of The Father is a good movie. Not great, but good. After all, it has a lot going for it: great acting (particularly from its headlining stars: Day-Lewis, Postlethwaite and Thompson), solid and assured direction as well as, obviously, a thought-provoking story about four individuals who were wrongly imprisoned for over 15 years for a crime they did not commit (as well as seven others sent to prison on separate charges). But belying these good aspects, is an over-simplified, poorly-paced and sometimes confusing version of the truth. The story that's being told of the 'Guildford Four' can be perplexing at times, largely because of the pacing and editing of the film. Characters are introduced in some scenes which leave you going ""Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?"", before it clicks much later on in the film who they are and what those scenes were about - and not in a good way. I'm sure a second or third viewing may clear up some of those aspects for me, but it usually doesn't speak well of a film if you're going back to watch it just you can understand what happened fully - rather than re-watching it to try and catch details you missed and/or analyse the film more closely.In addition, despite the lengthy run-time, the story is dreadfully slow and out of balance at times. For example, Thompson barely seems to appear in the film, and seeing more of what she did to try and get the Guildford Four out of prison would have been compelling. The out-of-kilter pacing also led to some strange moments i.e. we're told about Guiseppe, Gerry's father, leading a campaign to try and get them free; the result of which we only see in the last 15-20 minutes of the film. Much like Thompson's rare appearances, it would have been nice to see more of this, rather than merely being told it, and how it came about rather than seemingly going from 0 to 100 in the blink of an eye.In short, the over two hour run-time should have been cut down and streamlined, and could have almost definitely benefited from adjusting the story beats significantly. There are other issues with the editing such as (at least) two noticeably dubbed over lines, and (on a lesser note) unimpressive and boring opening and closing credits (not really that much of a negative, but I thought I'd point it out regardless). Because of these aforementioned issues, I can't give this film an overwhelmingly positive score despite its merits. I therefore sentence 'In The Name Of The Father' to a 7/10, with a possible re-review in the future to consider any other possibilities that may have been missed.Court is adjourned.",In the Name of the Father 1993.csv

In real life there are long periods when nothing exciting or interesting happens, but a movie cannot follow a character 24/7 in his daily life, even if that life takes place in Tibet.This story is very loosely based on the experience of Austrian climber Heinrich Harrer, who embarked on a climbing expedition on the brink on WWII and ended up as POW in a British camp in India, for most of the war.Having no reason to go back to Austria, he then ended up in Tibet where he met and became tutor to the 14th Dalai Lama. His adventure ended with the Chinese invasion of Tibet. That's it and it is already quite a lot.The plot is a journey of discovery, not only geographical but also psychological. Thanks to his experience, Harrer turns from selfish, arrogant and uncaring into a gentler human being.According to those who read Harrer account of his story, the film takes a lot of liberties, inventing episodes that - for me - are just supposed to make the story more cohesive. Also, I did not care much about Harrer involvement with the Nazi party, for which he apologised and that clearly was not the core of his existence.Finally, for those who protest because the movie does not explore Tibetan culture, once more this is based on Harrer's tale, from is point of view.

It was suspenseful because you never knew what stupid thing the main characters were going to do next. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see the next mistake. This movie was a joke. I have never been so disappointed with a movie I was so excited to see. After the girl escaped the house and was pinned in the car by Cujo, you knew the Blind Man was going to get her again. I was amazed at how much trouble these three people had with an old blind man. It doesn't matter that it was in his environment. Who cares. It was an old blind man for gods sake.

hunter-friesen,7,1,4,18-Mar-18," Who knew that a story about the worst film ever could be one of the better films of the year
","They say James Franco has made too many bad films. While I can partly agree with that statement, I like to look at his filmography as preparation for his role in his new film The Disaster Artist. Being both director and actor, Franco's film follows the true story behind the making of the worst film ever made, The Room. If we're going to learn about the true story about the worst film ever, then we're first going to have to learn about the people who made it. The main focus of the plot is about the friendship between struggling actors Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero. They each have little talent and try to look for work in Los Angeles. After months of auditions and rejections, Tommy decides that in order to get noticed he will need to write and direct his own movie. He finishes his script and with Greg alongside him, shoots his passion project, The Room. Things quickly get out of hands and the quality of the film sinks from really bad to historically bad.Franco observes Tommy's life as a sort of biopic and documentary mixed together. At the beginning, we have various real-life celebrities telling us how influential The Room is and how it should inspire everyone. We do get some background on Tommy and Greg, and how their friendship came to be. It's an almost sweet tale where lovable losers are our protagonists. The film also has a low quality feel and look to it. It resembles the source material for this story and works well at establishing a happy go lucky tone.One thing Franco stumbles on is giving us enough material on the making of the film. The first hour is spent on the friendship and then about half an hour is spent on the production of the film. This was a shame because the production was the best part and should have had more time to fully develop.Franco clearly has a message to tell about this film, and it's one that closely parallels his career path. Franco has never been afraid of trying different roles and methods. It's lead to some of his highest points, such as 127 Hours and Spring Breakers, and also his lows, such as Why Him?. Here, Franco uses Wiseau as the embodiment of the artistic spirit to do what you're passionate about. Wiseau has no talent and little outside support, but that doesn't matter as he won't let anything stop his movie. It's a call to arms for artists everywhere that you should do everything you set your mind to no matter your limitations.The acting in this film is both hit and miss, especially among its two leads. James Franco delivers one of his best performances ever as Wiseau. He goes all in at lampooning Wiseau's weird European accent all while having the same vampire look. Playing Sestero is James' real-life brother Dave, who has had a small string of successful parts in the Now You See Me and Neighbors franchise. Dave can't hold his smile back and doesn't really pull off the more emotional bits of the film. He has some charm and innocence, but he doesn't have the look or skills to make himself memorable. Filling the star-powered supporting cast is Seth Rogen, Josh Hutcherson Alison Brie, Zac Efron, and Hannibal Buress. They all play real people associated with the production of the infamous film. Rogen gets the necessary time for him to flex his comedic chops, but everyone else is subjected to cameo bits that restrict them.James Franco's talent as a comedic actor and director has allowed him to make a lighthearted film that tells an uplifting tale that isn't overplayed. Franco still has much to learn, but he's quickly growing as a filmmaker and isn't afraid to tackle a new project. Here's hoping he can follow up this film with something worthwhile.",The Disaster Artist 2017.csv
mjdemotts,8,1,5,21-Nov-07," Beowulf: A Lot of Butts and Guts
","The movie version of the epic ""Beowulf"" has been released, and it's actually pretty good. For those not familiar with the plot of the ancient Old English poem, it involves the exploits of the hero Beowulf (voiced by Ray Winstone) and his fights against the demon Grendel (Crispin Glover), Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), and a dragon. The animation in the movie is fantastic. The design of the Gothic castles and snowy backgrounds looks great. The fight scenes are very intense and well-animated, especially the climactic battle with the dragon. ""Beowulf"" uses a CGI-animation style similar to ""The Polar Express"", creating lifelike character models and emotions. However, although the main characters are lavishly designed, the characters in crowds or in the background look very dull and robotic. The film's script, co-written by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery, is very well-written, and adds depth to the rather two-dimensional story. The film gives explanations to Grendel and the dragon's attacks, and their origins. The movie touches on themes of identity, true heroism, weakness, and the price of immortality. It also adds humanity to the characters, showcasing Beowulf's arrogance and lust for power, the jealousy of the king's adviser Unferth, and Grendel's pitiable self-hatred, among others. This retelling of the legend differs from the source material in many ways, for the better and the worse. Quite a few changes have been made to the plot. Deviations from the original work include some of the dialogue, the portrayal of King Hrothgar as a drunken party animal, the amount of time that takes place before Beowulf's battle with the dragon and the relationship between Beowulf and Grendel's mother. Though these differences may bother some purists, the changes to the plot really help add to the story, sort of like ""The Lord of Rings"" movies. Overall, the film is a great adaptation of the tale of Beowulf. With a great cast, excellent animation, very cool fight scenes, and a few well-made changes to the plot, this action-packed adventure is not to be missed. A quick word of warning: ""Beowulf"" should not be rated PG-13. It barely manages to keep within this rating because it is animated, but it should be rated R for the gratuitous blood, gore, violence, and nudity. Many scenes, especially ones involving Grendel, are pretty gross, so be warned if you're squeamish.",Beowulf 2007.csv

hfhotaling,10,1,2,26-Mar-18," Good Will Hunting Stands as a Model on How to do a Low-Budget Film Right
","Good Will Hunting's plot follows troubled custodian Will Hunting (Matt Damon) as he tries to navigate relationships and life in 1997 Boston and Cambridge. Throughout the 126 minute film, Will's ego and psyche are challenged by the weathered Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) while finding something inside of himself he did not know he had with Skylar (Minnie Driver). This excellent and complex plot coupled with the outstanding music from the late Elliot Smith create an unforgettable atmosphere from start to finish. The screenplay finds a precise balance between distress and happiness which gives the film a unique footprint for future scripts to follow. The script is penned by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who also has a role in the film. During the writing stage of the production Gus Van Sant- the director of the film- visited Damon and Affleck frequently and later critiqued their writing method in the Introduction to the published screenplay: ""Ben and Matt would fly into action and create something almost spontaneously with Matt standing in the middle of the hotel room demonstratively gesturing and editing ideas by drawing dotted lines in the air with his hands, with Ben writing down dialogue on his laptop computer."" This spontaneous yet structured dialogue can be seen throughout the film, excellently mastered by the acting chops of Robin Williams and film royalty Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd. Robin Williams delivers a more controlled and stable character as opposed to his mostly zany and comical repertoire. His character arguably grows as much as the main protagonist throughout the film as he needs to open up in order to mentor Will Hunting. In the famous ""pond scene"" Williams delivers- in my opinion- one of the greatest film monologues of all time, creating a father-figure character in less than five minutes. However, Williams does not waste a chance to shine in comedy during a completely improvised scene about two thirds through the film.Independent films today have grown to focus more on art than narrative, which lowers the quality of the film. When there is little-to-no narrative in your film, there is nothing for your audience to connect with. An example of this problem in more modern cinema is the film The Mountain Between Us. While the film captures awe-inspiring landscapes, the dialogue and narrative is so poor it is hard to feel any sort of connection with the characters whatsoever. For reasons and examples like these, this is why I believe that Good Will Hunting stands as a model on how to do a low-budget film right.",Good Will Hunting 1997.csv

","As an avid moviegoer I cannot understand the life of me the fascination with this movie. It lacks so much and I can't believe people fail to see it. The movie has got action... great action but does it have plot? No. Does it have characterization?? No. Is it worthy a 9.0 rating? Absolutely not.Like I stated before, I thought the action scenes were really exciting, the un-realistic ness of it seemed a little silly at first but I soon got used to it and thought it was well done and cool. But the action was basically the only thing I thought was fantastic about the film.I really felt the film lacked in characterization and plot, it also dragged on really long and had plenty of useless scenes. For example the flashback scene in the desert could have been cut down to a mere 10 mins instead of the 20 or so mins it ended up to be. There were allot of pointless scenes that dragged out the movie, but it's the plot in general that suffered, there really wasn't a point to it all but based on the background of the story I felt there could have been had they focused more on the characters.WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE FILM.I never liked Jen's character. I thought she was really a bitch for lack of better words and at the end of the film her switch over to the good guys side seemed not only too predictable but ill timed. When Chow Yun Fat's character died I really didn't care or feel any emotional connection to him as all the scenes of Jen running around here and there should have been replaced with scenes to build on his character.I also didn't like the way the whole Jade Fox thing was resolved, the movie sort of drifted from that plot with all the Jen scenes especially that much too long desert flashback when we came back to the main plot I was a little confused. The story never really went anywhere and them the movie just ended. It wasn't well thought out plot but the backstory had huge potential.Based on all this I'd have to give it a thumbs down.

Red-Barracuda,9,2,3,11-Apr-11," Innovative and enigmatic horror film from Hitchcock
","Along with Psycho, The Birds was the other film in Alfred Hitchcock's double horror attack of the early 60's. While it isn't as good as the former, this is still a superlative chiller from the Master of Suspense. For those who don't know, it tells the tale of a young woman who travels to a remote fishing village with a couple of caged lovebirds; immediately thereafter the town is assaulted by the bird population in a bizarre collective attack.One of the chief strong points of The Birds is its sense of mystery. Hitchcock cleverly realized that what makes the film scary is the unknowable motivation of the title creatures. He plays upon the slight strangeness of birds, the way that we can never fully relate to them in the first place. Their subsequent assault is therefore made all the more frightening, as well as seeming plausible. Added to this is the idea that Tippi Hedren's character is somehow a catalyst for the bird attacks. She brings a couple of caged birds to the village and from this point all hell breaks loose. It's really left to the viewer's own judgement if they decide to read anything into this theory, but it is certainly a nice additional angle, and it even is addressed by characters in the film when the towns folk round on Hedren and accuse her of bringing this curse upon the town.Technically the film is full of trick shots. Some are showing their age but you really have to recognize that this is a movie from the early 60's and it clearly was cutting edge and ambitious. I'm not entirely sure, however, about Hitchcock's insistence in shooting characters in a studio to get the right light and then superimposing them in front of the background for external shots. He does this in many occasions here and it is sometimes distractingly false looking. Still, this is a minor complaint.Tippi Hedren is maybe my favourite cool blonde actress that Hitchcock used. For such an inexperienced thespian she really is excellent. Very beautiful and aloof; just what the character requires. Much like Marion Crane from Psycho she has a dark side to her, and she follows a similar path to Crane into the film whereby the story trajectory is such that it looks like it will develop in an entirely different way to the manner it eventually does. The ominous bird behaviour is slowly added into the film until it becomes the film. The attacks themselves are very convincing, while Hitch incorporates the birds themselves into some of his more traditional suspenseful sequences, like where all of a sudden we see the creatures massed on the children's climbing frame, which a few moments previously had been empty. Ever the experimenter Hitchcock also effectively has no soundtrack here. A very unusual thing to do. Instead he got Bernard Herrmann to create a soundscape made up of bird noises. A fairly avant-garde approach, but it works.The Birds is one of the best horror films from the 60's. It's also a great film from Alfred Hitchcock. Either of these aspects should be enough for most people.",The Birds 1963.csv

Most of the action takes place in the last third of the picture, but there is a great suspense building up to that point. And the special effects are jaw-dropping - Brundle's hideous transformation is reminiscent of Lynch's 'The Elephant Man'.

Animated_Antic,7,3,3,03-Jul-18," A wild and zany animated movie.
","The name Genndy Tartakovsky is a name that most animation fans will appreciate and even if you haven't heard of him, you probably have heard of the shows he created at Cartoon Network like ""Dexter's Laboratory"" and ""Samurai Jack"". The name Adam Sandler on the other hand, is not a name most film fans will appreciate. This was the man who did bring us some of the worst comedies ever made like ""Jack and Jill"" as well as create ""Eight Crazy Nights"" which despite it's grand and glorious animation is one of the worst animated movies ever made. Seeing the two team up is a little odd, though that's what they did with the help of Sony Pictures Animation which resulted in the movie ""Hotel Transylvania"", a film that has gotten an interesting reaction from both critics and audiences a like. Where the critics hated this movie, audiences seem to like it. As for me, I think it's decent. Is it a terrible and childish movie? No. So, is it a modern Halloween classic? Also no. I'll get into why in a minute, but first let me sum up the plot. Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) has built a hotel for all monsters to go to relax and go on vacation away from ""evil humans"" as well as keeping his only daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) safe after his wife Martha was killed by the humans years ago. With her 118th birthday approaching, Mavis is curious about the human world and wants to explore it though her father is still reluctant and wants to keep her safe. However, things go upside down for Dracula when a human tourist named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) accidentally stumbles into the hotel. Wanting to keep the guest from being scared, Dracula disguises Jonathan as a sort of Frankenstein monster and only gets into a bigger sticky situation when Mavis starts to develop romantic feelings for Jonathan. What happens next are lots of crazy shenanigans and fast paced humor that explaining the whole story would be too much so I'll just leave it there and get to my thoughts.This is certainly a very creative film. The idea of monsters staying at a hotel away from humans is a very clever and unique plot which does lead to some creative jokes and fast paced humor, though the film does have moments to let the audience catch their breath with some pretty effective slower moments. The scene where Dracula tells an emotional backstory in the film was actually surprisingly really well handled which is something I was really impressed with by the film. As for the animation, if you want crazy, zany fast paced animation, here it is. This film really knows how to do fast paced animation well which really reminded me of the old cartoons from 40's and 50's or even that Baby Herman short at the beginning of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" yet it does bring me to a small criticism. Though the film worked well in computer animation, it would have really shined had it been hand drawn. These character designs seemed to be made to be drawn by a pencil and not by pixels and it was even clearly proved during the end credits where we see 2D versions of the characters. It's nothing too major, but I feel that seeing it being done traditionally would have been a major plus for this film. Most of the jokes really work. Even though it is kind of juvenile at times particularly in the opening, this film did have some good laughs including a scene that took a stab at ""Twilight"". Yeah, I have to give credit to this movie. They really made a great anti-Twilight joke. Now how are the characters, particularly Adam Sandler as Count Dracula? Actually, they're mostly fun. I was a little nervous when I first heard the casting of Sandler as Dracula, but he managed to really pull off the character and his voice actually mostly unrecognizable. Even the other monsters in the film work. I think the funniest monster is Eunice who's the Bride of Frankenstein. Having her always push her poor husband around did make me chuckle a lot not to mention having her played by Fran Drescher was also an ideal choice. There are things that I didn't like about the movie, most notably the soundtrack. Man, this is one dated soundtrack. Although Mark Mothersbaugh's score is pretty good, the songs sounded like they came from an eight year old's kid's iPod from 2012. The autotune also really got on my nerves and having to listen to these terrible pop songs just irritated me.So while I don't think ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a great movie by any means, I certainly don't think it's as bad as what other critics have said. It does have a creative story, the animation is really fast paced and enjoyable (even though it would've been better hand drawn) and the characters did have some funny things to them. In my opinion, this movie seems to be suited as a fun silly movie to throw on during a party and that's it. I think it's good for a one time watch, but really it's not much of a classic.",Hotel Transylvania 2012.csv

joe_beck,8,1,5,03-Sep-11," A full-throttle, coming of age, arcade style beat em up...with more than a couple of laughs to boot!
","The film is a highly entertaining teen/early twenties kung-fu romance, which sees Brit comedy director Edgar Wright teaming up with American indie sensation Michael Cera in this action packed comedy.The narrative progresses quickly after introducing Scott (Cera) and his pals, following the story of the young man's (surprisingly eventful) love life. He is soon infatuated with a cool chick, Kim Pine (Allison Phil) and sets out to gain her attention despite already having a high school girlfriend, and granting his up-and-coming band second fiddle to his new love interest. There is much to be said of Scott Pilgrim's unique visual style and its quirky comic book and computer game references that build into the narrative, and add innovative layers onto the film's Toronto-set, music scene world. These touches certainly grant the film a unique, uber-modern quality. Combined with punchy, plot-progressive editing and a fun, quick-fire script that will remind Edgar Wright fans of his earlier hits (Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz), Scott Pilgrim skilfully uses both gaming and comic book culture to create a highly watchable, and at times very funny character driven filmic experience.Cera puts in a fine, Cera-typical performance, doing what he seems to do best, (he will have both the unemployed and geeky kids aspiring to be him globally.) Yet Superbad and Juno fans may be shocked as he launches into action, dealing out spinning kicks and ass-whoopings like he's put in some serious hours preparing for this stumble-upon martial arts skills, fist-swinging-action role. There are other nicely drawn and well scripted characters such as Scott's groupie high-school girlfriend, lovable but none-the-less frightening knives Chau (Ellen Wong), and some particularly memorable ""evil ex"" boyfriends that Scott finds himself facing off against.Praise aside, the film does seem overlong. Timing in at just under two hours, any longer and the rolling credits may have warranted a deep sigh of relief. However, for a film that was only ever going to end one way, and which almost exhausts its comic book-like onomatopoeic labellings, the movie is surprising, engaging and ten times more fun than two hours down an arcade bashing the buttons of a beat-em-up video game.",Scott Pilgrim vs. the World 2010.csv

Well, I did enjoy ""Saw 2"" over all, it had good suspense and kept me interested. But I think it did loose it's originality and I felt empty at the ending. A lot of moments I found to be very pointless or like the director only used it just as a way to get the gore. Like the group being locked in a room together, now for those who haven't seen the film first, it does all come together, but I'm going to say that the violence did seem unrealistic and the reactions were either a little late or early. I don't know, lucky enough I haven't been in a situation like that, so maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions.

Most of the first 30 minutes moves from one conversation to the next, but your attention is held fast by a cast-iron grip. That the filmmakers can make several minutes of Redford making call after call at his desk gripping is awe-inspiring. And the dialogue between the characters (not just lead, but supporting, also) carries an authenticity you don't often see. Men engaging in heated discussion, talking over one another that makes you forget these people are reciting lines; it rings true-to-life and these actors disappear into genuine newsmen.And while ""All the President's Men"" makes heroes out of Woodward and Bernstein, it by no means glamorizes their job. It's because of the hours upon hours of work they put in, their dogged determination that the story breaks. Hoffman and Redford have a natural chemistry, and two newspapermen become classic movie characters for it.This is a powerful movie; riveting, very well-made and for my money, the ultimate political thriller.

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerGangbusters effects and terrific camerawork propel Steven Spielberg's film well into its last act, when it runs out of energy and ideas. This collapse is especially disappointing because War of the Worlds begins as a provocative look at how terror affects family and community, that is, something more complicated than an explosion movie. If the first part of the film offers an absorbingly detailed look at the family's dysfunction, the ride in the minivan tightens the focus, as they struggle to make sense of the disaster unfolding around them. ""Is it terrorists?"" asks Rob. No, says Dad, this ""came from someplace else."" Rob tries again: ""What do you mean, like Europe?"" This brief comedy only sharpens the scares that follow, not all caused by aliens. Indeed, two of the most awful scenes involve people fighting each other.This and other particulars -- a monstrous surveillance eye on a sinuous, seemingly endless arm invades Harlan's basement; clothes from disintegrated victims float through tree branches; a peanut butter sandwich Ray has thrown at the kitchen window slides almost imperceptibly down the glass as he wonders what to do next; Ray asks a man who appears to have survived a plane crash, ""Are you a passenger?"" -- create a potent mix of recognizable and fantastic moments.

Â¿How come Boston was all messed up and destroyed, and the kid's grandparents seemed dressed like they were headed to a church party? Â¿Why did everybody walked so peacefully and calmed, headed to the same place, instead of hiding or running in circles? I guess that would've been a lot more realistic reaction. But no.

Funnyman1235,8,2,4,21-Feb-08," Knocked Out of the Ball Park?
","Forgive the rather redundant pun. The end of the day what I should try and summarise quickly is that this comedy is actually funny. Considering that my view of romantic comedies is that they tend to play for the safe laughs and an expected happy ending. Knocked Up does not do that.The premise itself is rather risquÃ© when painted as a romantic comedy (which this film is over the gross out comedy more often associated American Pie or Apatow's other work The 40 Year Old Virgin) as essentially a slacker impregnates a beautiful, though equally clueless, woman.Overlooked completely are the leads in this movie. While Rogen gets most of the laughs (and deservedly so) it is Heigl who gives the best performance. Her breakdown in the clinic is completely believable and brings a tear to even the most unemotional human being. Equal applause should go to Leslie Mann (Apatow's real life wife) who despite being essentially the nemesis of the piece gives just as important a performance as a woman trapped in a souring marriage. Paul Rudd is the only of the four leads who isn't given enough to really shine. Hilarious in Anchorman and Apatow's earlier piece here he feels like an add-on to the main cast.Nevertheless the film is brilliantly written and superbly performed by everyone. The highlights are undoubtedly the beard jokes ('your face looks like Robin Williams' knuckles) and Harold Ramis' Alzheimers skit. All the while remember that the two leads are actually have a lot of the same neuroses and fears as anyone in a relationship and that is perhaps the film's strongest point that despite the aesthetic differences between the pair. Ben actually makes Alison happy after initial teething's and that perhaps is the strongest suit of the film that the pair are completely believable despite the inevitable smutty jokes.

","""Corpse Bride"" is one of the best animated musicals since ""Beauty and the Beast."" Danny Elfman is co-creative force with director Tim Burton, as the delightful songs, music and piano playing courtships match the distinctive ensemble of characters. There are no schmaltzy Disney ballads as the songs, sung by the character ensemble, help to reinforce plot and character points. While the songs aren't classics, they are hummable. With a few more additions, Elfman could turn it into a theatrical production. Each character has delightfully exaggerated features (who didn't want to cut Johnny Depps's drooping forelock off during the Academy Awards?). The crowded Victoriana setting is as fraught with visual possibilities as ""Howl's Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro)"" and Hogwarts in Harry Potter. The color scape is almost all moon-lit black, gray and blue. The film is charming and funny from the opening through its smidgen too long 76 minutes (though I didn't stay through the credits). The stream of visual jokes and one-liners may go over kids' heads, such as the head waiter. The tributes to old movies also come fast and furious, from the Harryhausen piano to ""The Gone With the Wind"" satire, the Heckle and Jeckle dream sequence from ""Dumbo"", ""Barkis Bittern"" seems to look a lot like an older ""Gaston"" from ""Beauty"" or maybe ""Dudly Do-Right,"" and more.

First, the champion 'Blue Bear' in the climax championship fight would have been disqualified, and very likely charged with criminal assault. Second, in the Nursing home, if a monitor is turned off, an alarm goes off at the Nurses' station--that in fact would be how they knew that Maggie Fitzerald had bitten her tongue. Third, this Nursing home was allegedly providing good care; yet the gangrene-caused amputation would not have been needed if the patient was provided with appropriate exercise (e.g. Christopher Reeve). Finally, Frankie Dunn's fingerprints would have been on the breathing tube; the surge in adrenalin would have been discovered at autopsy, and he would then be a fugitive in a murder case.Hollywood finds liberal issues attractive, such as the euthanasia applied to Maggie, and this film will no doubt receive a number of academy awards--perhaps even best picture--but is over-rated. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank turned in superb performances, and any awards they receive are deserving. The film itself disappoints, and it is a shame. None of the technical issues noted above needed to be there.",Million Dollar Baby 2004.csv

TinyDanseur27,7,1,3,20-Jun-13," Ralph Fiennes's modern take on Coriolanus is risky and edgy. Success!
","Ralph Fiennes did a modern take on Coriolanus. The setting was present day in ""a place called Rome"" which was made up of many different locations. Tanks, machine guns and knives served as the weapons, and costumes were made up of a mix of American and Russian military attire. I really appreciated the decision to set the play in a different time. It's risky and edgy and I think that it made the play way more accessible. I'm no Shakespeare expert but I think Coriolanus is not one of his most popular works. Bringing it to the silver screen in this manner really showed people just how great of a play it is.What I think the movie did for Shakespeare in this instance was highlight some of the beautiful subtleties in the dialogue. Performing it as a play, the actors must project to convey the story. Having recently seen Coriolanus on a stage, I experienced that projection firsthand. I feel that some of the dialogue was better said in a whisper though, a whisper that could only be done in a film. There are some breathtaking scenes with Vanessa Redgrave and Jessica Chastain that are quiet yet passionate. I felt that the film allowed for a lot more dynamics throughout the play.",Coriolanus 2011.csv

dragontony2005,9,3,7,24-Mar-14," My opinions of Frozen
","For starters I actually didn't know about Frozen until I saw pictures of a Korean Cosplayer named Tomia doing cosplays of Elsa.Whilst I haven't been a major fan of the Disney princess franchise, I have however been knowledgeable in their styles of portraying the princesses in the films.What really hooked me onto Disney Princess franchise was basically Tangled which is a modern day reboot of the classic franchise using music to express the character, drive the story along and the prince who helps the damsel in distress and then they live happily ever after.So since Tangled is the most recent and notable modern day CGI Disney princess film that can be compared to Frozen... I would have say Tangled was better than Frozen.Most of the marketing campaign I have seen for Frozen has always featured Elsa on the front which immediately misleads people into believing Elsa is the main protagonist of the film.As I am aware, Elsa was meant to be the villain and the decision to change her was a perfect idea because Elsa stood out and had the looks, the back story, internal problems, magical elements and the aura of the heroine/princess that immediately makes you question why she was not the main character.Anna was the ironically the 'princess' of the film who would have done great in the original scripts, but the redesign of Elsa pretty much dropped Anna down into the side character list who role is to be a supporting character... but yet retains the role as the main protagonist, whilst she had her fair share of problems... I felt Elsa problems were more of a main focus than Anna's... Ironically the actual prince of the film did predictably turn out to be evil... like the moment he declared he was 13th in line and immediately asked Anna to marry him. Come on it was kinda obvious when Elsa has been so redesigned that even her 'villain' act didn't have much effect and you still get that heroine aura.Nonetheless the film was fantastic and was a great hit especially with the let it go song and the scene of when she transform and built the Ice palace... If anything... I would like to see a sequel or a remake with Elsa as the main aim... though I hope that Disney has learned from there mistakes and will produce another great film next time.",Frozen 2013.csv

nitzanhavoc,8,3,5,29-Mar-19," To paraphrase Saucy Jack - ""Years from now people will look back and say that Cube gave birth to 21st century Psychological Horror"". It sure did.
","I've always been a devout fan of story-centered Horror films with smart and surprising plot twists and endings. To me, these films (for instance many titles by James Wan) embody the perfect combination of Horror and Psychological Thriller (most titles of the Saw anthology come to mind as a shining example). As a fan of such, I must pay proper respects to Cube, which just might be the title that had originally presented this particular sub-genre years before the first Saw reinvented it (even though it sadly fails to deliver an actual plot twist).As the plot summary and trailers have most likely told you already - Cube begins, continues and ends with the struggle of six strangers who awake to a living nightmare in which they're trapped inside a giant maze rigged with traps. The way I see it, Cube relies on three main features. First, the film's main feature is deception, as everything we're made to think we know about each character on one hand and their devastatingly discomforting predicament on the other first comes into question and later, at times, shatters completely. This serves as a metonymic representation of the fact that nothing around is familiar, known of comprehendible, both in the maze and in the characters' lives as part of human society.The second feature is discomfort, which has become a key characteristic of many modern Horror films that have crossed the classical boundaries of a haunting ghost or a hunting killer. From the start, the main antagonist is the setting (i.e. the maze), into which the characters have been forced and out of which they barely have a prayer of escaping. As stress, fatigue and of course hunger and dehydration are gradually added to the equation - the characters become paranoid and distrustful, sometimes for good reasons. The genius single location and lack of any flashbacks and past/future scenes only serve to enhance the sensation of discomfort: there's nowhere and no time to which the characters can escape, the nightmare is real and is the only thing that exists for them.The third and less profound feature is the philosophical dimension added by the characters' different perceptions and attitudes regarding life's rules of conduct and terms of endeavor, so to say. As they discuss and relate their own individual explanation to their situation - questions of life, humanity and personality arise, making the viewer constantly think and ponder while following the characters' attempts at survival and escape. While this might have been considered a relief from the aforementioned sense of discomfort (since focusing on anything but the reality of the nightmarish predicament might give a false sense of hope) - it turns out it actually feeds the fear and despair, as each explanation is both realistic and authentic (to the extent you'd attribute logic and rationale to conspiracy theories and sci-fi scenarios) and more terrible than the other.The acting is professional and excellent, the story is original and innovative and the plot is compelling and suspenseful, always keeping the viewer on edge. Even the minimalistic soundtrack is great, although too much resembling a Slasher theme in my opinion. The only let down for me had been, as I mentioned in the beginning, the blunt lack of an actual plot twist, or an actual ending. While the open ending could be considered another element of discomfort and lack of clarity - I firmly believe a smart plot twist would have made this film perfect.And yet, made over two decades ago - Cube still sets a standard few Horror and Psychological Thriller titles manage to meet today. It isn't frightening of that scary (as it doesn't really rely on fear), but a true psychological Horror combining discomfort, torture, despair and pursuit which manage to exquisitely deliver every stressful and agonizing sensation to the viewing audience. While this is solely my personal opinion - I can't recommend this film enough, even to those who aren't particularly fond of Horror films.",Cube 1997.csv

themadmovieman,8,3,7,07-Sep-17," Not only a brilliant zombie blockbuster, but enthralling and riveting all the way through
","In what is easily the best zombie movie in recent years, Train To Busan proves an enormously entertaining watch at every minute, featuring twists and turns galore to the backdrop of an intensely action-packed battle for survival, yet still with an incredible amount of emotion and heart, thanks to some very well-developed characters and strong performances throughout.There's a lot to love about this movie, but I'm going to start off with why it makes the zombie genre, one that often falls flat, really work. For me, zombie movies are regularly frustrating watches, proving to be nothing more than two hours of running away from a mass of mildly threatening things, and never really allowing for anything different to spark genuine interest or excitement.Fortunately, what Train To Busan does is keep the simplest and most effective characteristics of the zombie genre, but make sure that it never loses sight of what makes a good film. As a result, while there's so much fantastic zombie action, and some properly intense violence that makes the undead far more threatening villains than normal, it's the film's story that really makes it work so well.Above all, the depth of character development is the biggest success of the whole film. Starting off with a concise and interesting introduction to our main characters, looking at a father obsessed with his work and how that has alienated his own daughter, the film doesn't languish about when it comes to being more thorough, but the background that it does give you is absolutely vital for the rest of the film.Following on from the father and daughter, we're introduced just as efficiently to a couple of other major characters on the train that will be integral to the fight for survival, and it's the fact that get a genuine emotional insight into each of them that means you can really fear for them in this situation, and will them to survive against what seem like impossible odds.Throughout, the film proves itself bold and daring by making sure no major characters are 100% safe, and that means you're sitting on an emotional knife-edge at every moment. It's not the action and pace that makes this film a thrilling watch, but the fact that you're so enthralled in the story, and each and every turn proves yet another incredible twist.The performances in this film are also just as strong. The excellent character development is matched by a selection of both likable and brilliantly dastardly performances across the board, and although that doesn't always excuse the occasional stupid character decision to advance the plot, it reinforces your emotional connection to the leads, and with the likes of Gong Yoo and Ma Dong-seok in particular putting in fantastic turns, you won't be able to look away from the movie's fantastic heroes.And finally, I can't forget to say that this movie is a hell of a lot of fun. Its drama may be enthralling, and its emotion powerful, but it's still a playful and hyperbolic zombie movie that will put as much of a smile on your face as put you on the edge of your seat. It's not a downbeat, apocalyptic disaster movie like World War Z or so many Hollywood zombie flicks, but rather a vivacious and rapid-fire blockbuster full of life and humour to go along with its excellent story.Overall, I was absolutely thrilled by Train To Busan. An incredibly entertaining movie that outdoes almost every zombie movie before it, it impresses with excellent performances and directing, and a story that prioritises enthralling characters and genuine drama over simple thrills and spills, but still leaves time for a load of great zombie action.",Train to Busan 2016.csv

brando647,6,4,6,18-Jun-16," Peter Jackson's Epic Six-Movie Tolkien Series Ends with a Disinterested Shrug
","Finally, Bilbo Baggins returns to the Shire. After three bloated movies originating from around 300 pages of content, we've reached the end and I'm so glad to be done with it all. After a total of six movies set in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth, I'm totally fine with never hearing the word Hobbit again. His HOBBIT series concludes with the grand finale, THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES. When we last saw Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), and their company of dwarven companions, they had been left to gape helplessly as the dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) got tired of chasing them through the mountain kingdom of Erebor and took to the skies to burn neighboring Laketown to cinders. This movie rejoins the action at that very moment, abandoning the dwarfs to focus on Smaug and local hero Bard (Luke Evans), who chooses to engage the dragon. Ten or so minutes later, the whole dragon plot that kept us trudging to the theater for these movies is resolved and we spend the next three hours on the titular battle. You see, Thorin immediately begins to succumb to what the dwarfs call ""dragon-sickness"" and what us normal folk would call ""greed"". He's got his rightful kingdom back with more gold than he could ever need, and now he refuses to share it with anyone. The men of Laketown, led by Bard, come knocking in hopes of at least getting some gold for their dwarven-caused dragon troubles (i.e. the incineration of their entire town) and Thorin refuses. Even the woodland elves of Mirkwood Forest come stomping in with an army to demand a share. And, of course, the orc commander Azog has unfinished business with Thorin, having devoted two full previous movies to hunting the would-be dwarven king in hope of ending his bloodline. So all of these armies converge on the front lawn of Erebor forÂ…wait for itÂ…the battle of the five armies.Six movies deep into this franchise and I can safely say THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES is my least favorite of the bunch. I was so burned out on Middle Earth by the time this movie came around that I refused to see it in the theater. It's the only Peter Jackson/Tolkien movie that I never saw in the theater. I didn't bother watching it until the extended editions were released. In a movie that already feels like 90% filler, I can only imagine what had been added after the theatrical release. Sadly, most of this movie is utterly forgettable. The visual effects are impressive and the 45 minute final battle sequence certainly looks good, but did we need any of this? I don't think so. And, come on, 45 minutes is just too much. That's 45 minutes of CGI swarms of dwarfs, elves, orcs, and men hacking and slashing at each other and the occasional diversion to see what our heroes are doing so the story can keep pushing on. This means that every so often we'll break way so we can seeÂ…I don't knowÂ…Legolas (Orlando Bloom) hanging upside down from a giant bat monster while swinging his arms wildly to slice and dice a bunch of cartoon monsters that aren't really there. If I sound biased against this movie, it's because I believe its existence to be completely unnecessary and the whole exercise of creating it a gratuitous waste of time for Jackson and his crew. Tolkien's tale could've been handled in two better-paced films. I've been against the heavy use of CGI in these movies since AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY was released and this film just shoves it in my face with unmercifully long sequences of those same hated CG effects bouncing off each other. Would it have killed them to use some of those amazing practical costume/makeup effects for orcs in the foreground to give it an added sense of realism?THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES is only really interesting for the first act and the final act. Everything in the middle could've been trimmed generously. Unfortunately, when the big tragic moments begin to happen in the final act of the battle, I'm so worn out from the battle itself that they hold no weight. By that point, I'm just wishing we could skip to the end. THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES isn't a horrible film but I can't imagine it rising to the top and becoming anyone's favorite Jackson/Tolkien movie. It's got some nice stuff in there. Martin Freeman is still perfect for the role of Bilbo, even if he has nothing to do here. I loved the addition of Billy Connolly to the cast as Thorin's cousin Dain and I loved his behind-the-scenes interviews even more, where he admits that he never cared for Tolkien's work and freely mocked anyone who did. Smaug is still awesome for what little time we're given with him, and Jackson even found a way to shoehorn Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, and Christopher Lee into the series one last time. If I remember the novel correctly, Tolkien spares us the full details of the battle, choosing to knock Bilbo out when the action starts and filling him in later. In my ideal cut of Jackson's HOBBIT series, we'd get the same treatment. Bilbo is knocked unconscious and the movie would fade out; we fade in, the battle is over, the surviving characters fill us in on what happened in the form of a flashback montage. Keeps the movie a pleasant length and spares us from battle fatigue. In retrospect, I still enjoy Jackson's HOBBIT movies. The first one is enjoyable enough and was actually pretty solid. This third one thoughÂ…ouch. An epic six movie series and it ends with a shrug. That's the real disappointment.",The Hobbit_ The Battle of the Five Armies 2014.csv

bopdog,10,3,4,28-Jan-07," Marvelous masterpiece! Forest Whittaker went far beyond a mere character impersonation, to recreate the essence of Amin
","Forest Whitaker did an amazing job here. He resembled Idi Amin--- looked like him, moved like, and sounded like him. But Whitaker's performance was much, much more than a mere impersonation. He really inhabited the guy. The vibe was so full, and so complete! It was as if Whittaker recreated him in a perfect translation for us, the movie audience. That is a rare and marvellous thing. Whitaker more than deserves his Oscar nomination. There are some worthy candidates for best actor this year. Others also did great jobs, and deserve to win as well. But Whitaker also clearly did a masterful job, and clearly deserves to win as well. His portrayal went far beyond the trendy and gimicky 'impersonations' of famous folks.The story is scary and sort of creepy. But as far as a westerner such as myself can know, it appears to be real. It has a ring of truth and authenticity to it. News stories report the Scottish doctor character was indeed a conglomerate of real-life white visitors to Amin's world. I was engaged and engrossed in the movie from the first scenes that took place in Africa. What an amazing movie! And being true, it also rang with a certain satisfaction that not many movies do.The Scottish doctor was all too human. He was not painted as any kind of do-gooder or saint, which I liked. How many of us could have resisted the temptations he was faced with? I would guess that most of us would have done exactly as he did, and probably worse. Even though he was a fictional character, it seems that he was based on a conglomerate of western, white people and their behaviour when confronted with the favour of koo-koo despots with unlimited power and wealth. He was seduced. But I think most of us would have been as well.Overall, a stupendous movie! Please don't be shy about the reality theme, nor the grittiness. it had some gory moments, but wasn't all 'The Killing Fields'-y, as I had feared. It was thrilling, fast-paced, and truly human. I gave it a well-deserved 10 out of 10. And good luck at the Oscars, Mr. Whitaker! I hope you win.",The Last King of Scotland 2006.csv
coreyjdenford,8,7,15,02-Sep-16," Fun Food
","This is my review of Sausage Party (spoiler free)**** (4/5)Cast: Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Bill Hader, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, James Franco, Paul Rudd. Plot: Shopwell's supermarket is full of happy groceries, waiting to go to the 'Great Beyond'. But one day they discover evidence to suggest there is a much darker future in store for them.In the original Shrek, the Gingerbread Man is tortured by the malevolent Lord Farquaad. Dunked in milk with his legs ripped off, he's threatened with even worse bodily harm. ""No, not my buttons!"" he squeals. ""Not my gumdrop buttons!"" It's apt that Conrad Vernon, the man who both created and voiced 'Gingy', is also one of the directors of Sausage Party. Because, like the scene described above which is arguably the most violent that movie can get apart from the beer fight. This unlikeliest of summer-season animations is a weird hybrid of cutesy cartoon and horror flick, a tale in which awful things happen to sentient food products. It may be a weird hybrid between the two but it's both very very rude but very very funny in its use of random rudeness but that particular influx of randomness pulls through in what could be the greatest animation ever. It's arguably an intended spoof for the creators of Superbad Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen to make a mockery of all the animations that they love/loved as either children or adults. Our hero Frank (Rogen) who has unimaginable feelings for his bun-friend Brenda (Wiig, on top form once again, and also more confident than ever) and he shares his packaging with Barry (Cera, in his bravest role ever), and Carl (Hill, in possibly his shortest role ever as he doesn't last very long) see that life in the supermarket isn't quite what it seems, as Frank goes off in search for the truth. There is one point in this cutesy animation that makes it a creepy horror flick, because this also uses violence not the slapstick you normally get in films like this but guts out violence, in what could be described as the most violent scene in any animation ever. Beyond all the Pixar-like feelings this film will give it is nowhere near child friendly but with its charm and vulgarity it shows that adults can love animation too. What if the premise of a film like Toy Story, in which inanimate objects come to terms with the meaning of their existence, was pushed to its logical dark-as-hell conclusion? There is an increasing amount of glee in Sausage Party (a tale about pork that is more sex-obsessed than Porky's) as it heads towards its demented denouement. Brought to life by sub-Pixar but decent CGI, as it bustles with anthropomorphic edibles. There is a tomato voiced by Rudd, a sultry taco with the tones of Salma Hayek and even a Hitler-esque sauerkraut shouting ""exterminate the juice."" In case how man food based puns there are; the answer is a lot. At first though it seems that, that is all this seems to offer, with enough raunch to make a beetroot blush. Gradually, though, this reveals itself to be a bold piece of work with some rather big ideas. The return of a panicked jar of honey mustard (Danny McBride) to the store, raving about the abuse meted out to food items by humans, triggers an existential quest for Frank to go on and he goes to extreme lengths (pun intended) to search for the truth. There is a concept of organized religion that is explored, as the lone sausage tries to convince his blissed-out companions they not be headed for a glorious after life, but rather a knife-assisted oblivion. Even the Israel/Palestine conflict is riffed upon, through the unlikely medium of a relationship between a lavish (David Krumholtz) and a bagel (Edward Norton, doing a big, goofy impression of Woody Allen and just about stealing the show). There are smarts to Sausage Party that are well-concealed between layers of utter filth, which ramps up and up until a late set-piece that will likely make you choke with laughter: think Caligula re-enacted by condiments. Bringing to mind a go-for-broke vibe of South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, the final reel unleashes debauchery and mayhem of a kind that makes you wonder if a studio exec ever checked in on the production. There are some barren bits â€“ there is a villain that is an actual douche (Nick Kroll) who's more loud than funny, and some of the gags have the feeling that the writers got them from a box of Christmas crackers â€“ but Rogen and Goldberg have succeeded in cooking up something truly original. Also in its incredibly short run time it delivers laughs out the whazoo, rudeness and food related violence and sex. The finale, meanwhile, suggests yet another Meta sequel could be on its way. It leaves us to believe what these sausages could get up to next. You may even forgive it for being incredibly short. It's nice to see Seth Rogen on top form once again.Verdict: It sounded like the dumbest movie of all time, but it's actually smart, subversive and packed with famous voice, saying wonderfully unspeakable things. In fact, it's a banger.8/10 balls out entertainment.",Sausage Party 2016.csv

","Rear Window is a great example of Hitchcock's mastery of cinematography. This movie follows the story of Jefferies, an adventure seeking photographer that is stuck in his small apartment due to a leg injury he received while on the job. He resorts to finding entertainment by watching his neighbors through his rear window. When he notices some suspicious behavior from one of the occupants across the way his boring recovery becomes a lot more interesting. Through solving this mystery Jefferies learns a lot about himself, his relationships with others, and how people interact with each other.
This movie is a great example of using lights and shadows to create suspense. By having the entire movie filmed from one vantage point, Jeffeirie's apartment, the light was pretty restricted. However, Hitchcock creates amazing effects with minimal light. By using the window blinds to highlight certain parts of the room Hitchcock is able to make certain moments in the film more intense for the viewers. One of the most effective ways lighting was used to create suspense was by only having the eyes of the actors in the light. This made the characters more mysterious and invoked a sense of fear into the viewers.
Overall this was a fantastic film that incorporated the elements of cinematography extremely well and had a entertaining and captivating story line.",Rear Window 1954.csv

","James Gray's ""The Lost City of Z"" (pronounced 'Zed', to my chagrin) is a contemplative study of purpose and what drives us to seek what we see as our destiny. Subverting the expectations of the viewer, Gray takes us deep within the Amazonian jungle only to frustratingly yank us back just as we get used to our surroundings. Each time we get closer to where we think the film is taking us, until we are thrust back out again. The same can be said for Charlie Hunnam's Percy Fawcett on his quest to find his lost city.Hunnam proves capable of shouldering the weight of the lead performance, an irony due to the simultaneous presence of his King Arthur movie in theaters. But he deserves the credit he is being given for this film, as I haven't enjoyed a performance of his this much since his time on Undeclared (and I suffered through all seven seasons of Sons of Anarchy). Robert Pattinson gives an understated yet powerful performance as Fawcett's aide-de-camp, Mr. Costin, and seems to be on quite the ascent in his career right now.Not perfect by any means, but well worth your time, The Lost City of Z provokes discussion at its conclusion. Apt, as the themes explored in the movie do not fit neatly inside a box, wrapped up tightly with a bow.

oecobius,3,20,53,25-Jun-11," Disappointing
","Mary & Max sets out to be a thought-provoking film that inspires with its originality, but it is ultimately an unsatisfying production. The opening scenes establish the film's nonlinearity and its willingness to be blunt and grim with its protagonists' struggles--once you notice these features, you grasp the film's entire hook. The movie constantly maintains this tone but never leads it to a payoff or a twist; I appreciate the filmmakers' decision to make something so unconventional, but the fact remains that these few original elements cannot support an entire 90-minute movie. The creative animation is definitely the best part. The film is in large part a dark comedy, but all the comedic elements are tepidly clever at best but never truly funny. The quirky concepts have potential, but they are intended to be funny in & of themselves, never building to any new surprising result. Max's descriptions of his jobs, for instance, aren't poignant or charming, they're just ""zany"" with some angst thrown in. The film relies obnoxiously on scatological humor--even though this is usually deadpan, the sheer number of butt jokes gets old very fast. Through the events in Mary's life, the movie sets up what could have been a moving message about accepting your own flaws, but the impact is spoiled when they hit you over the head with the message, via narration by both Damien and Max. Towards the end, Max's lengthy letter about being happy with yourself is so heavy-handed that it eliminates any possibility of thought-provoking subtlety. The very end of the film was also cheesily melodramatic and unsubtle. I didn't feel moved by the characters' suffering along the way, either, because we meet Mary as a lonely, bullied kid... and then the movie describes over and over how she's lonely & bullied, which has no impact on us because we understood that from early on. The same goes for Max being lonely and awkward.There is obviously great effort behind the animation, with impressive, detailed sets, and the art style is engaging. The ""Que Sera Sera"" sequence in which Mary reaches the depths of depression is artistic and very nicely-done, but the film's successes in terms of visual presentation do not compensate for its story or hamfisted theme, which fall flat in the end. If you just want something out of the ordinary, you can enjoy Mary & Max, but if you expect true depth (not phony depth where the filmmakers comment ""oh, loneliness sure is sad!"") or richness of writing, you will come away disappointed.",Mary and Max 2009.csv

","As a teenager myself, it is sickening to see the way teens are portrayed in this film. Shallow with their minds in the gutter 24/7 and blatantly disrespectful. Although it might be accurate, there is no excuse for this film to be pretty much promoting this kind of behavior. I did find some parts quite funny, but mostly they were sick jokes which made me flinch and I don't see how anyone could find them funny at all. But I suppose in order to appeal to the larger teenage audience they made everyone into a stereotypical teenager. Surely they could have made the characters a little more believable instead of the only things on their mind being parties, vanity and sex. And people today wonder what has gone wrong with young people. Movies like this certainly don't help. I find it disgusting and insulting. At least the movie was right about something.

Tigen,10,3,8,12-Oct-99," Misunderstood classic. Profound.
","Looking over some of the negative comments, I find most of them seem to arise from people seeing the movie with preconceptions and expectations not borne out by the film.  Case in point is the widespread comparison to ""Saving Private Ryan.""  As others have said, these two movies share little in common beyond being ""war movies"" and are good for very different reasons.Saving Private Ryan, while a good movie, is about as unsubtle in its presentation as a movie can possibly be, displaying gratuitous gory action and having an obvious and shallow theme (about courage, sacrifice, rememberance and all that...worthy to be sure but nothing new).  It is a mainstream, mass-appeal action movie with a politically-correct, All-American theme.  Its popularity was written in the stars.Then we have ""The Thin Red Line.""  People aren't sure what to make of it. Some people come in expecting ""typical war movie"" and are bitterly disappointed.  Others are just bored with it and couldn't care less about the questions it raises.  My take is that it is a cerebral, fascinating, thought-provoking movie depicted with superb cinematography and a unique style.  Its multiple meanings are right there under the surface if you care to look, although the real meaning is in the feelings it (should) evoke.It isn't the characters who are all having these philosophical episodes while under fire...it's supposed to be you, as we see the events though the eyes of the rather dreamy fellow the movie mostly follows. SPR tried to make you feel like you were there.  TTRL presents the action more as a case study in humanity, where the individual personas are unimportant compared to the broader questions about life itself.  In this way it goes far beyond the token anti-warness of Saving Private Ryan (although admittedly foregoing some of the high-adrenaline action of the latter).One of the negative reviews here hit the nail on the head comparing the movie to a nature documentary.  That reviewer didn't see the relevance of showing the singing natives, the colorful animals, and the beauty of the island.  He must have trouble with such concepts as irony, juxtaposition, imagery, and all that other jazz your English teacher droned on about in high school.  ""Where is the anti-war message?"" asks one reviewer.  Well, it's the entire movie.In the end, The Thin Red Line works on many levels.  It will go down as a misunderstood classic because it doesn't sit down with the audience and patiently explain a nice, easy, Hallmark-card sentiment.  It flies right over the head of Average Joe.  That may sound arrogant but it's the simple truth, and you don't have to be Einstein to comprehend this movie.  The ""main character"" wasn't a smart fellow at all, he simply observed the world using his natural common sense and wisdom.

","Touted as Toy Story with animals, the latest family-friendly adventure from Illumination Studios (Despicable Me, Minions) takes a light-hearted peek behind the door at the lives of pets residing in a Manhattan apartment block. All is well for these domesticated creatures until Max (Louis C.K.), a spoilt Terrier who loves his comfy existence, doesn't return from a visit to the dog park, sparking a perilous journey throughout the Big Apple led by the indefatigable Pomeranian Gidget (Jenny Slate). The first half hour is full of laughs as we meet our eclectic group of pet protagonists, but once the trek through the streets commences the jokes dry up at an alarming rate, largely because it fails to add anything to the lost-in-the-big-scary-world formula. The characters are a mixed bag too, a few memorable ones carrying the bland other ones. The quiet ball of fury Gidget, the nonchalantly self-centred cat Chloe (Lake Bell) and the hyper-energetic bunny Snowball (Kevin Hart) leave the biggest impression. But it ticks all the right boxes to ensure kids will love it: bright and bubbly animation, a bopping soundtrack, non-stop visual gags, quotable dialogue, very few quiet moments and, in Snowball and Gidget, two pets who would be a hoot to own. Considering the potentially hilarious concept and the great opening act The Secret Life of Pets squanders it's opportunity to land in the higher echelon of animated flicks, nevertheless it's an easy, breezy 87 minutes of uncomplicated kiddie fun.",The Secret Life of Pets 2016.csv

Somehow I was thinking of Jane Fonda who I think could have done it up brown but sadly, Fonda is not a money screen name anymore. Some think that Streep should win some kind of award, I don't. Sure, it's a good role and she knows it and does justice to her part but Acadamy Award caliber, no.

","Hancock is better than The Hulk and is as good as Iron Man, and here's why.Some reviews I've read on this board seem malignant as they continually rain on good movies parades. They actually see movies with the feeling that they WANT the film to fail. Why, so you can talk trash about it on a message board? I will start this review off by saying there's not a single thing wrong with this movie. Sure, some people feel as if they would have made it differently, but that's not them. They're not the ones behind the scripts or the cameras. Behind them is a team devoted to bringing us what we love about a summer movie: great action sequences, cool characters, and a decent story with good looking people. That's the definition of a summer movie people. Now, moving on...I thought I had seen all the best moments the movie had to offer in the previews, but low and behold I was wrong. The scenes in the trailer take place within the first 30 minutes, while the next hour is a well developed story involving superhero origins, complicated relationships and some intense action.You can pretty much guess the story from the trailer, however the movie is far from predictable; a man with super powers who is depressed wants to help the world while society shuns him. Feeling he can help, Jason Bateman's character Ray decided to invest in Hancock and make him personable again. You know he spends time in jail, hates it, then gets called to help out the city when it's in trouble. That's the story right there. Granted there are more twists and turns involving our hero but it is not, repeat NOT what you expect. Will Smith is also very funny in this movie, cursing at neighbors and children while maintaining his A-Hole approach to a hero.The story is ORIGINAL, something hardly any movie nowadays can claim, especially movies in the superhero genre. The background of the hero, as well was his powers' weakness is something I've never seen done before. And guess what? The bad guys are the bad guys! The bank robbers, purse snatchers, rapists and crooks are the people Hancock is battling against, something that all heroes should be fighting, not some made up villain that can easily match the good guy.

","Since seeing Backdraft in 1991, I've been waiting for Ron Howard to return to something a bit more gritty. And with this film, he found just the right balance. Rush deftly captures the essence of rivalry. It also depicts an accurate look at the 1970s. I can relate to both since I was there in the 1970s and I've been through the intense rivalry that comes with steep competition with a group of adept people that face possible elimination. Without even trying, it's all too easy to be identified as someone's enemy. It's only when it's all over and done that you realize that your enemy wanted to be your friend.Right from the get-go, the cinematography and audio mix hit you. That was my first indication that this was a high-quality film. Then, after a while, it becomes apparent that the characters are really strong. There's a definite sense of authenticity to this film and the later races really get the blood going. I actually worried about the drivers and was 'hanging on the edge of my seat' as the old expression goes. Be sure to check this film out -- even if you're not really a fan of racing.

Roles are generally understandable but I think some scenes can be eliminated, in these eliminative scenes I was bored and these parts can be seen as really complex scenes. Other than this complexity, movie begins in slow pace, and you start to identify the characters. After this identifying process movie becomes to be interesting and mysterious, from this part on you cannot be distracted, you totally focus on the events. During this passionately watching period, facts are started to shown and they surprise the viewer. Then, on the movie finale, all facts are clarified. I can frankly say that the ending of the film is terrific. Finally, no matter how old the film is, with its plot and all the things it makes feel it can be figured out that Rosemary's Baby is really fantastic movie. Also it is on the top 250 list of Internet Movie Database and I think it is one of the most worth watching films.",Rosemary's Baby 1968.csv
Falconeer,5,3,6,19-Oct-19," Forgettable, Generic Horror
","If you want to understand how far the quality of horror movies, and cinema in general, have disintegrated over the years, just watch one of these new-age, current movies, back to back with something like ""Return of the Living Dead,"" (1985.) or ""The Beyond"" (1981). The decline in quality of our entertainment is sad and astonishing. ""Road To Busang"" is another modern zombie movie, utterly indiscernible from all the other current horror crap, with it's flat, cheap cinematography, fake looking CGI, and this desperate need these current zombie films seem to all have, in bringing emotional drama into a genre where it is laughably out of place and just ludicrous. Some exciting zombie chase scenes are present and the large cast is impressive, but we have seen it before, in movies like ""28 Days Later."" Honestly, there is nothing new here, and the only outstanding quality is that little girl, who gives quite an impressive performance in this. On a side note, all the raves and compliments showered upon a cast member who played a cheerleader, made me curious to see what all the fuss was about. Imagine how shocked I was to see the ""Goddess"" is actually some little girl with thin, stringy black hair that looks like a cheap wig for a witch costume, legs like toothpicks and the facial features of a down syndrome victim. Is this the current idea of beauty? Did anyone else wonder where her chin went? Maybe it got eaten by zombies. It seems like the beauty standards have gone down the sewer, along with popular taste in film and music. I find this a bit sad. ""Train To Busan"" is one of those popcorn flicks that you watch once while texting on your phone...something that you forget 5 minutes after you see it. I refer to the majority of current films and music as ""throwaway entertainment."" Nobody is going to be talking about this movie 2 years from now...nobody will even remember it.

","Similar to my rating for this film, you can argue that 9 out of 10 people who watch this movie, it will not be their first Scorsese film. Most of us know the genius that he is and coming into this showing we should expect brilliance, and gladly he delivers a captivating storyline driven by great acting. Unfortunately with the release of Shutter Island was also a press release that Taxi Driver may be remade, so that news made me hesitant to care, but I'm glad I was wrong.Shutter Island is the story of Teddy Daniels, A U.S. federal marshall sent to the island with his partner Chuck Aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn't comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy's wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don't think this film would be the same without them.Even to begin explaining details of the plot and how everything comes to fruition causes me to feel migraines alike the ones Teddy gets in the movie, therefore I won't ruin anything for you now. Take my honest word that if you enjoyed any Scorsese movie in the past or have enjoyed movies that include surrealism, Shutter Island combines the two into an intense thriller that boggles the mind and possibly even ""corrode it, rusts it"". Also, if you are hesitant to watch this film because the trailer perceives it as a horror film with a lot of ""jumpy"" scenes, ignore that. I had the same feeling entering it, and there was only one towards the very end, but it was worth the shock. You will miss so much detail trying to cover your eyes for a few minutes sporadically throughout that it's not worth it.

ClaytonDavis,6,7,17,05-Jan-13," Subpar Tarantino but Waltz and Washington shine!
","There's been no film more divisive or more igniting in terms of strong Oscar speculation then Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained. After months of shooting, word of a last minute edit (some believe editing is still going on currently), the film has finally hit cinematic eyes and the ""final"" product is both bold and misguided. Django Unchained is big and full of Tarantino life and color that we've come to love about him. On sheer production value, it's his finest film endeavor to date. Set designs are simply gorgeous, Robert Richardson captures some beautiful shots, and Sharen Davis proves once again, she's one of the most awe- inspiring designers working today. Tarantino does go a bit ""out there"" in his choices of dialogue along with the developing and rising structure of the story. Where Tarantino succeeds is in digging some terrific performances out of his principal cast, even if his film is at times lunky, problematic, and a bit messy.In the opening title sequence, Tarantino uses one of the best film theme songs this century and setting up ""Django"" for an audacious roller coaster ride. The film tells the story of Django (Jamie Foxx) who with the help of his mentor Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) becomes a bounty hunter in the 1800s and sets out to save his slave wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of an evil plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).Anyone who knows my cinematic mind, knows my feelings about Jamie Foxx and his abilities as an actor. For the most part of his career, I've found him immensely overrated, though excels quite well in comedic driven vehicles. As the uneducated yet craftly-minded Django, Foxx does one of his finest works. As satisfactory as Foxx is and given the nature in which the character is written, he gives Django a needed sensitivity that lacks in this grotesquely violent portrait. This isn't to say Foxx doesn't fault. His interpretation of Django at the beginning of our tale, fresh off the slavery line and later becoming an A-list free bounty hunter is not entirely on point. Not always being believable, at least in drama, is Foxx's major flaw. Where he'll start by burying himself into a character, by the end of the three-hour finale, Foxx's natural and Foxx-mannerisms reveal themselves in an awkward fashion.When Christoph Waltz came into our lives as Hans Landa in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (2009), many cinematic-lovers thought their lives would never be the same. Waltz's ticks, evil grin, and astounding portrayal went on to win, very deserving, the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. As Dr. King Schultz, Waltz recaptures much of that magic and demonstrates once again, he is one of the most talented actors to grace our land in quite sometime. What Waltz demonstrates so brilliantly is how he can both inhabit the soul of a man with no remorse or fear to take life yet have this potent and clear sensitivity for humanity. A divine interpretation. Waltz is fearless, becoming a man with no obvious background, and building one of the finest portrayals by an actor this year. Simply superb.In a near-mute performance, Kerry Washington, and make no mistake, is absolutely magnetic and steals focus from every single actor in every single frame. As Broomhilda Von Shaft, Washington delivers a performance reminiscent of Holly Hunter's Ada McGrath in Jane Campion's The Piano (1993), a turn Oscar recognized and is equal in talent and execution. Besides the obvious beauty Washington naturally exhibits, her heartbreaking and bravura work stands at the top of anything she's delivered in her respectable career. Though the work is brief, and in many ways a background ornament that some might miss, without it, the film and the fable would feel simply meaningless. Washington is purely fantastic.As the flamboyant and wicked Calvin Candie, Leonardo DiCaprio steps out of his usual comfort zone and is as charismatic as I've ever seen him. When Calvin is on an even keel, telling a story, and simply on his lower register, DiCaprio excels. It's when the work hits the high notes, over-the-top anger or forced fuming yells, it can often feel stale in its execution. One thing I've noticed is that Tarantino attempts to give DiCaprio, and the character Candie, instances of an ""evil monologue,"" where the audience can find the brutality of his motivation spelled out on the screen for all to see. Tarantino attempted this in past films like Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004) with David Carradine in the scene with the Bride and B.B. and the infamous story about the fishbowl. In most Tarantino films, this tactic works. In the newest effort, it doesn't come off as a natural disposition and simply out of character. The only conclusion I can come up with his either Tarantino doesn't fully understand his characters and/or their motivations, although he did create them, or simply the editing and the timeline didn't give him enough time to fully develop Django Unchained into the story he envisioned. With all this said, DiCaprio is still memorable and should be worth the conversation of any awards body.As the grumpy and vulgar Stephen, Samuel L. Jackson delivers his best work in years, reminding audiences that when teamed up with Quentin Tarantino, Jackson can stand next to any other actor working in the business. One of Tarantino's successes in the screenplay is the creation of Stephen, a head of house slave for Candie. Jackson is the comedic backbone of the film and steals focus from many of its performers including DiCaprio and Waltz. Also making a brief but memorable turn is the talented Don Johnson as Big Daddy Bennett, a slave owner that moonlights as something even more offensive. Making a cameo, Jonah Hill makes his mark and makes it well...Read the rest at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",Django Unchained 2012.csv

","Steven Spielberg is well-known for his moderately-budgeted, box office hits and classics, but in 2005 he brought to the screen a new and different looking adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novel that was truly an intense shocker; War of the Worlds. Starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, this sci-fi blockbuster revisited the alien invasion sub-genre with a vengeance; think 'Saving Private Ryan' but as a PG-13 movie with aliens as the enemy. The violence was not held back, the intensity was dialed all the way up and the performances of the two leads were spectacular. Tim Robbins' small but effective role was pleasing as well.When it comes to the alien invasion sub-genre, there have been many films released to this day that have both been great and terrible (terrible being the recent Skyline and Darkest Hour films; they had great aliens and designs, but terrible scripts and direction). Happily, War of the Worlds was kind of a mix of Saving Private Ryan and Independence Day, having the intense close encounters with thousands of people being killed off, and an emotional human story at the center of it all; a father trying to bring his family to safety. The script was fantastic, having only a couple moments where it wasn't all believable. The visual effects, top-notch, even to this day; Steven Spielberg knew how to place their money on the sets and CG. The music was as classical as ever as well, with John Williams bringing us another suspense-filled masterpiece that's also loaded with emotion and trauma. For the film itself (in running time) there were plenty of unanswered questions, but some of those questions could be answered with a sequel (which i hope Steven sees), while some questions you have to answer yourself.Overall, War of the Worlds was and is a fantastic alien invasion film that shows us that a sci-fi blockbuster can act like a powerful war drama loaded with heart and emotion.

ssvikas,7,2,3,24-Sep-13," Dramatic tension and Authenticity of F1 in the 70's
","Making films about real life characters always presents a challenge; more so if one of them doesn't live to see the day his tale is made into a film. Coming from director Ron Howard, known for films like 'Apollo 13', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Da Vinci Code', 'Rush' is about two great personalities in the high adrenalin Formula 1 racing. The story begins on the start line where Niki Lauda (Daniel BrÃ¼hl) narrates the story of how James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) influenced his life and the days of Formula 1 in the 1970's where it was not uncommon for drivers to die in accidents. James Hunt, who in real life was known as a playboy is appropriately portrayed on screen. There's a scene from his early days where he walks into at a hospital to get his injuries treated and lo behold, he seduces the nurse in James Bond style! Then, we are introduced to his career in Formula 3 where he drives for Lord Hesketh's team. Although the film marks the meeting of Lauda and Hunt in the F3 race on a sour note, it is believed that the duo were actually friends and shared an apartment during their early days. Was this an error? Or was it deliberately avoided to bring about dramatic tension between its lead stars right from the start? We wouldn't know. The character of Niki Lauda starkly contrasts with Hunt as he is cool, calculating, working with the team on developing the car and isn't bothered about partying or popularity. In real life too, it is believed that Lauda never let the achievements get into his head and he gave away his trophies to a local garage in exchange for car wash.Discussing the story itself isn't necessary for the review as most of the critical elements of the plot are based on actual, well known events. Its most poignant moment is how Lauda returns to track merely six weeks after a near-fatal crash with bandages on his wounds and leads the championship till he pulls out of the season's last race at Fuji when the treacherous weather conditions made the race too dangerous. 'Rush' does a wonderful job in recreating the F1 races, the imagery of powerful engines, tires ready to zoom as pedal hits metal, and the infamous NÃ¼rburgring crash of 1976. In fact, Niki Lauda in his interviews has praised the filmmakers for portraying the crash and his treatments in a realistic manner and that the scenes 'shocked' him. Reportedly, the actors weren't allowed to drive real Formula 1 cars. So, the film makers are said to have used F3 cars with the bodywork of F1 cars of that era to make them look like the real deal. Still, they drove some mean machines. Wow! The actors have done a good job and look like their real life counterparts. Chris Hemsworth still seems like Thor with the long hair, but less bulky. Daniel BrÃ¼hl, an acclaimed German actor embodies the role of Lauda, Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller, Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Knaus and Pierfrancesco Favino as Clay Regazzoni have done a neat job and there's not a moment where it feels inauthentic. What works for the movie, other than the stunningly recreated visuals is the emphasis on its characters. At its soul is the portrayal of how Hunt and Lauda influenced each other's lives and careers. Although the two champions were very different by their outwardly lives, they shared a common passion for racing and winning and looking at each other to seek the much needed challenge and why you need enemies!Verdict: if you are one of those who like Bollywood family dramas branded as racing films, like Ta Ra Rum Pum, let me assure you that 'Rush' isn't for you.

BigMez,9,547,899,20-Dec-05," Moral Choices and the Dark Side of Humanity
","I just got back from an L.A. screening of Hostel. I haven't seen an effective horror film like this in a long time. My stomach was still knotted up after we left the screening. The last time I felt like that was when I saw ALIENS for the first time about 19 years ago. Since then, no other horror film has ever made me feel like that. I certainly didn't expect it from this one. As much as I loved Cabin Fever, I'm not blind to the shortcomings of its script. As such,I was expecting more of the same from Hostel - dark humor, gore, and a sense of dread. I'm happy to see that director Eli Roth has taken a big step forward in becoming a better storyteller and filmmaker.Admittedly my heart sank when the film began. The scenes introducing the main characters were blandly shot and edited. All I could think was, 'Oh no. Roth succumbed to some unseen studio pressure to make a normal-looking horror flick'. The style was typical of the what you'd see in crap like I know what you did last summer. But in very subtle ways, the blandness gets washed away and as our heroes enter the threshold of Hell, the style of the film changes as well. This, I learned during the Q&A afterwards with Roth, was intentional.If you've read some of the other reviews posted here from people who saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, you get the general idea of the story. Contrary to what you might've heard, this is not a 90 minute film on torture. The torture scenes are brief and to the point. Roth doesn't wallow in pointless gore. And this is where I think it shows how he's improved as a filmmaker. He's more interested in scenes and ideas that move the story forward. Yes, there is plenty of gore, but it's relevant to the story and doesn't exist just for it's own sake.One of the aspects of this film that made it so powerful was how Roth created a sense of helpless and inevitability. He provides the dark setup, throws in a sympathetic character, and begins twisting the screws and ratcheting up the suspense. This isn't a movie where you turn off your brain to enjoy it. On the contrary. The more you think about it, the more horrifying it becomes. You begin putting yourself into the character's situation and wondering what you'd do. When you realize that there is no hope for the character, no way to escape, no 'buddy' who's gonna turn up at the last minute to save the hero, and not a shred of humanity or compassion to the antagonists, real fear begins to set in.Another great element in the script is how the 'survivor' makes moral choices that define their character. Instead of being merely reactive like the characters in Cabin Fever, the survivor makes several decisions which change the course of the story. It's a sign of well thought-out script and a filmmaker who cares about the fate of his characters.For horror fans, this is an absolute must-see. It's so refreshing to see a horror movie that actually makes you feel uncomfortable and one in which you have no idea what's going to happen next. As for the gore, I was surprised by what they got away with. Although there were no credits at the end of the film, the cut I saw was rated R by the MPAA and according to Roth, he didn't cut anything out.",Hostel 2005.csv

To make things worse, they extend the movie to well over 200 minutes long when 80 minutes would have been more than adequate.  Even cheap documentaries aren't this boring.  At the end of the movie, I was left wondering what the whole point of the film was.

But yeah he was really good in this as the astronaut that gets left behind and has to survive using his intellect and resources at his disposal. And keeping on very optimistic perspective on things despite it dire situation. Which is the reason why he kept chugging away at it without not even trying. While this is going on, the greatest minds on earth are working on a way to bring him back home alive by using their brains, wits and will power. It's like watching nerds working on science projects after science projects to accomplish something really cool. The ideas and direction just kept getting more clever and clever as it progressed. And as it progresses the build up makes you really care as an audience on what is going to happen and because it actually feels like a lot is at stake, although it's a rescue mission to save one man. So near the end, there is quite a bit of tension. I mean I wanted to get out of my seat and cheer although it's a fictional event. I also liked the message at the end about not giving up and keeping hope alive.

Couldn't agree more with the comments regarding the belches of grumbled, mumbled dialogue that frothed like a soiled nappy from those poor unfortunates. Did anyone else feel that this painful tripe was so transparent in it's futile attempt to be 'trendy' and deeply significant? Artistically, (and I use that word loosely), it was a mismatch of sound and vision - from the silly pretend blood daubing virtually every male forehead, to the mistake of purchasing too much quilted material by the costume department. On a plus side, it would make a great stomping ground for male grooming products. The ultra close-ups of a male beard actually growing were unsurpassed.Throw a couple more shrimps into the cauldron, Bruce.",Macbeth 2015.csv
jwpon,8,1,1,06-Jul-03," The story was only okay, but the action was great, and a terrific plot twist at the conclusion
","If you're looking for a really deep story, with great character development, there are probably better movies than T3.  But for non-stop action that leaves you riveted to your seat, and interesting twists in the story of John Connor, I think T3 delivers the goods.  After reading so many strongly negative reviews, I went to T3 with lowered expectations, and received quite a pleasant surprise.  I think Nick Stahl did a credible job as John Connor - I found myself having no problem accepting him as the young adult incarnation of the future savior of humanity.  Arnold, although 12 years older, is still THE Terminator (although I felt a few of the gags, such as the star-framed glasses, were silly and inappropriate).  And I think Kristanna Loken was good as the T-X; attractive as she was, I think she was sufficiently terrifying.  While the movie doesn't develop the characters, it didn't prevent me from sympathizing with and rooting for the good guys.  The action scenes were excellent - the first chase sequence was one of the best I've ever seen.  And the ending came as quite a surprise.  A thoroughly enjoyable movie.  Whether this was the end of the Terminator saga, or if there's a T4, I think the movie was a worthy successor to T1 and T2, definitely worth the money, as well as the 12 year wait.  8 out of 10 stars.",Terminator 3_ Rise of the Machines 2003.csv

","C- Lo and behold, it's the only Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin film I actually care for. I saw it at a young age, and have seen it well over twenty times if not more over my years. If you, especially like me as an aspiring film maker, take a gander over the pair's many productions over the years, you'll realize the actual amount of creativity and talent they have can fit inside of a pin head. Their movies are predictable and serve merely as popcorn movies. As far as revolutionary sci-fi goes, it only qualifies in the category of special effects and nothing more. Of course the ships target the most popular cities first, it's movie's basics. My sole praise is to the obvious that of the extraterrestrial ship and body design. Naturally, my favorite part is the alien autopsy scene, the amount of detail put into the creatures. The film's use of miniatures is appreciated as well.As for the characters, Jeff Goldblum is pretty decent, and Will Smith is the usual gun-ho protagonist. Mary McDonnell and James Duval also star in not too bad of roles. The performances don't bother me; it's just that I'm not emotionally invested in the characters because I know who's going to die and who's not. To truly experience a modern sci-fi achievement, check out ""District 9"", a text book example of a fresh take on aliens, or in my humble opinion Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"".

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS--This movie was WAY too long. There's like a whole 35-40 minutes of actual story crammed into a two and a half hour long movie...Several characters serve no useful purpose at all whatsoever...Link's wife, was she necessary? What about the councillor and most of the people in Zion? Was there any need to show them in this film? They didn't advance the story at all.In fact all the Zion scenes were a total waste of time, especially the much reviled rave scene, which does nothing but bring the film to a crashing halt for 15 minutes.People who say this film is some kind of deep philosophical triumph just make me laugh....you people must experience religious epiphany reading cereal box ingredients. There's nothing original or groundbreaking about this film at all in terms of its philosophical stance, just a bunch of quasi-deep mumbling by the Architect which in the end amounts to nothing and/or contradicts everything they have said before.Trinity and Neo have no chemistry at all together and are so wooden it's very difficult to care about what happens to them. In the first movie you could actually see them as people instead of some kind of CGI kung fu robot in leather. Fishburne as Morpheus is great as usual but is not enough to carry the film. Apart from Niobe's character there is no other performance worth mentioning.Of course the SFX are top notch, but for what? Whatever shred of story there is is just a vehicle to get from one action sequence to the next. Were TWO fights vs hundreds of Agent Smiths really necessary, wouldn't one be enough? And then what's up with the fight with the guy who's guarding the Oracle....totally unneccessary other than to show off the same tired bullet time effect, which was used well in the first film but ridiculously overdone in this one. By the 7th or 8th time you've seen it done it's annoying. Not to mention there's no sense of danger involved at all. You KNOW nothing's going to happen to any of the main characters which totally robs all the fight scenes of any sense of drama. We already know who will win.This movie was very disappointing. I enjoyed the first one a lot because it actually had a plot and a storyline that went somewhere, this was just pure crap. A bunch of action scenes and pseudo-philosophical garbage trying to pass itself off as a smart movie. I guess it is smart for an audience of braindead teenagers.

","I wasn't familiar with the hero of this movie beforehand, the great expeditions weren't really a thing taught in our schools. What little I know on the subject I picked up from random documentaries, old Tarzan movies and not as old Indiana Jones movies.Basic material of this movie was interesting, an age old story of adventure and discoveries. Both of them weren't to be found. Instead we were treated with a glimpse of the dreary side of a life of an adventurer and his family.Now, don't get me wrong, this movie still could have been watchable, I do not believe a second that Indiana Jones was an accurate depiction of a real life explorer.What constantly threw me off and kept me from immersing myself in to story was that there really was no story to speak of, and script writer, as well as the director seemed to have lost any sense of time. From what I have understood from documentaries and movies, expeditions weren't taken lightly. First they were several months, even years at planning and funding stage. Actual expeditions took at minimum several months, even years to complete. Yet kids at home got born during expedition. Same kids kept growing only when plot required it. Same kids completely forgot their dad only after what seemed to amount a few pitiful months, year at most.In addition to poor concept of time there was no sense of ecxitement. At no point I felt the burning need to see the lost city which was supposed to be the ultimate goal of the movie. Basically I sat on a chair, waiting and hoping for the city to show up or the hero to give up and die as a bitter old man.I can not recommend this movie to anybody.",The Lost City of Z 2016.csv
Quinoa1984,8,8,22,07-May-09," The New/Alternate Generation
","JJ Abrams is a smart director - at the least smart enough to know what makes the original Star Trek show from the 60s, as well as the movies at their best (see Wrath of Khan thru Voyage Home), appeal so strongly to everyone from hardcore trekkies to just your average TV or movie-going public at large. It's a good script. Smart, actually, enough to try and give some new ideas or at least give us some characters to give a damn about. In his revised version of Star Trek he starts at the beginning, only an alternate beginning: it's still Kirk, Spock, ""Bones"" McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, Chekov and (for a little while) Scotty, but there's some slight changes, alterations in the lineage thanks to a meddlesome, incredibly ticked-off Romulan.In this case Abrams and the writers, Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzmann, get to have their cake and eat it in terms of story and character development; they can reboot a franchise right from the start but with some extra surprises. And because it treats time travel with a fresh perspective - you may be confused at first as to why Spock appears not only as his young self played by Zachary Quinto AND as the (formerly) one-and-only played by Leonard Nimoy - there's no limit to what can occur in a franchise that is only beholden to the original in terms of staying true to the characters, their methods and personalities, and the essential things that make Trek what it is with its ships, the federation, Klingons and Romulans, Vulcan, everything. It's a truly inspired screenplay written by people who love the show, and want to get right to the heart of the big behemoth to see what makes it tick.If there are any complaints they're mostly minor, in terms of technical things. Abrams, who's only previous film was the third Mission: Impossible feature, isn't always assured during the fight scenes and cuts around a little too fast and jagged to always take. There's also a pet-peeve that one can have with lens flare (you may know what it is, in layman's terms it's that blue and other colored light that comes in horizontal lines, of which in this film I lost count), which became I assume an artistic choice as opposed to a flaw, one that didn't serve the movie really well. And while it's definitely a step up for Abrams in getting top-notch performances, especially from young actors who are definitely getting their biggest breaks yet here (albeit some are already stars and character actors, some unknown by me), there's a treatment to the direction in the movement of it that is somewhat akin to TV. Sometimes this is not a bad thing in the slightest; whenever scenes out in space were shown, in big battles or otherwise, it was fantastic, spectacular footage, by far the best in the entire franchise. As for ""dutch"" angles and rapid-fire camera movements...But I digress, what most people will be concerned to know is: are these new kids the real deal? Do they fill in the shoes of iconic pop-culture figures like James T. Kirk and Spock and everyone else on the Enterprise? Without a doubt, they all rise to the challenge. Chris Pine is Kirk without having to submit to a Shatner imitation (save, arguably, for a couple of scenes like when he hits on girls or is doing the Kobayashi Maru test), and he makes Kirk his own through and through; he makes me thoroughly excited to see where he'll go in this rebooted series. Ditto for Quinto, who brings his own calm and intensity to a Spock that needs to rise up to meet his elder form right in front of him at one point. Others like Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, (of course) Simon Pegg and John Cho, they're all a pleasure to see not taking over roles as imitations, but just being themselves as the characters.So, Star Trek, this revised edition is up to the standards of a franchise that can concern itself with action and suspense and adventure, but is also as much character driven as it is with story. No matter what quibbles I might have with certain aesthetic choices, this is the best we've seen from this diluted and over-exposed franchise (I mean Trek in general, through all of its re-incarnations of Next Gen and Deep Space 9) since its previous hey-day in the 1980s.

","And we wonder why there are so many mass shootings in America!Tarantino takes the unlimited pursuit of freedom of expression beyond sanity in this brutal gorefest. No matter how many times Mr Obama gets up and says that the killing must stop, it will never end as long as this sort of stuff is produced as entertainment. In a normal, sane world, Tarantino would be identified as a psychopath for having written and produced such murderous mayhem, but America is not such a place. They lionize him and march him triumphantly down Hollywood Boulevard, with as good a chance as anyone of picking up a golden statue at the end of the route. The theatre should have provided vomit bags because there are so many anti-peristaltic scenes that it's inevitable that someone's gonna upchuck before the show is over. The strange thing is that there were NO gasps of revulsion from the audience through the whole length of the screening. Are we inured to such violence as a society? So why do I rate it a ten? Well, it is a perfect and excellent example of what is wrong with a society where guns and violence are glorified. Once you accept the film for what it is and get over the fact that you're actually watching it instead of volunteering at the food bank, you realize that it is tour de force of acting and production. All of the main characters are powerhouses of evil,with the secondary roles the personification of wholesomeness. Tarantino engineers a very clever juxtaposition of these human qualities with the way he structures the story, and the scriptwriting is just superb underneath the bloody and horrific mess. It is amazing that Mr T manages to weave some of the most politically incorrect language and culturally unacceptable behaviour into characters and make them almost endearing to the audience. Kurt Russell, Samuel L Jackson, Tim Roth and Jennifer Jason Leigh give fantastic performances but everyone in the cast is excellent. If I ruled the world, stuff like this would never make the screen but I don't and so I have to understand that the aforementioned freedom of expression trumps everything else.

","The story of The White Ribbon is narrated by The School Teacher (Ernst Jacobi) of the village many years after the events took place. He states in the opening moments of the film, that much of the story is based on hearsay and speculation. He even concludes; ""a lot of it remains obscure to me even today."" Set in a small Protestant village to the north of Germany, in the year building up to the First World War, a series of mysterious events, accidents, and seeming torture, occur that begin with the local doctor (Rainer Bock) being throw off the back of a horse in suspicious circumstances. The occurrences escalate through the village, bringing with it accusations, and divide, in an already hierarchically structured ""society"".The tension builds throughout this masterfully structured narrative, with confidence of pace, and some beautifully composed black and white cinematography, by long time Haneke collaborator, Christian Berger. Haneke is a film maker at the top of his game. The intricate relationships throughout the village, the power struggles, and authoritarian menace, is perfectly acted by a strong cast.It's no crime to reveal that nothing is resolved in the film. But, like in life, other more terrible events happen outside of the surroundings you dwell in, beyond your usual environment (the people for example), that evaporate the issue from memory. And, like history, we can read this as a fable about authoritarianism, and it's effects on the people around it. As allegory of war, it shows the utter contempt for humanity is lost in those who have been victim to this dictatorial rein of fear. In this village, we are only exposed to the corporal punishment that is dealt on a daily basis, to the children of the village.

doctorsmoothlove,4,13,26,30-Sep-09," The wrong media
","District 9 was directed by Neil Blomkamp who was originally going to direct an adaptation of Halo, the famous first person shooter video game franchise. District 9 isn't Halo, but it might as well have been. Blomkamp's film shares many storytelling elements with popular action videogames and shares their most severe weakness.As many action or shooter gamers will admit, ""gameplay is more important than story."" When someone is designing a video game in either of those genres, player interactivity must be given the most resources. Many times a story is literally attached for no other reason than giving players an excuse to find a new environment. This method is employed in District 9, and is permissible only in films with no aspiration for greatness. Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor or any of Takashii Miike's films is pure entertainment. No one really cares about the artistry or intelligence involved in their production, even if the films are creatively redundant. The video game genres I've mentioned can get away with this if environments are carefully constructed and players can interact with them in many ways. Story is emphasized in other genres.District 9 fails to impress me because it takes an idea that would have been a great video game and reconstructs it into a media that doesn't suit it. The entire movie is an obvious allegory for Apartheid, with numerous scenes of intense bloody violence. What scant storytelling occurs is formally presented and then ignored. A District 9 video game could have slowly introduced us to the protagonist (an inspector of the non-human zone District 9), and included character development when ""tragedy"" befalls the protagonist. He actually partially transforms into an extraterrestrial and gains their ability to use machinery. It's very similar to Prototype. Later levels of this video game would permit players to control the extraterrestrial hero the protagonist befriends.As a film, the idea doesn't work. Because the story is so brief, Blomkamp is forced to depict too many shootouts. They become boring after the first hour. Nifty camera angles, including a first person perspective, occasionally break the tedium, but serve to remind me of what this film should have been. Summer is over and now we are finally starting to see films which people put effort into creating. District 9 is one of these films yet it is so uncomfortable that it falls into the end-of-summer blockbuster category. To my knowledge there is not yet a video game time-in to this film and that's a shame. A Syphon Filter approach would have suited this story nicely. As a film, though, I delegate it to the rent-it-and-return category so many blockbusters find themselves after their theatrical release.",District 9 2009.csv
Astralan,8,2,3,11-Jun-08," Pleasantly surprised and enjoyable.
","This was a delightful film. The deep rich color, the contrast, most of the caricature development and voices seem to come together to make a wonderful experience. The story follows the dream of a fat panda and his desire to be trained in the ways of Kung Fu. Laced with a serious overtone, the comedy is on a more mature level, but a level that even a young child can follow and enjoy. Paced well, the movie starts off as well as it ends. A bit predictable once you know all the components in the character constellation, even the anticipation lends its self to the experience.I have to admit, the most enjoyable and laughable scene to this movie revolves around Po (The panda, voiced by a Jack Black) and what is discovered to motivate him to learn the teachings of his master Shifu (Voiced by Dustin Hoffman). Shifu has been left with the task to train Po to become the ultimate warrior, much to the chagrin of his other disciples: A tigress, a snake, a praying mantis, a monkey and a crane, who have studied for years to become the level of Dragon master. Unfortunately, there is also another beast, a previous student of Shifu, that also believes that level belongs to him. In the end, dark forces against that of light must meet.One thing I always find disconcerting is that why, out of all the people in the world, do movies like this need to generate any interest from already famous actors? There is so much talent out there, I would think leaving live acting to live actors. Or how about a radio announcer? Or a person that does audio books? I have a hard time believing that this movie couldn't have used an unknown to be a primary voice and still kill at the box office. Just my opinion.The theater was sparsely populated. I think my wife and I were the only ones there that didn't have young children. The lack of an audience allows for a more pungent viewing, one that isn't caught up in a wave of laughter that usually infects a viewer at a well attended presentation. One very young child tried very hard to understand what was going on through most of the film in a rather loud voice, but this was acceptable. I don't think a child of 3 can truly enjoy this, even as a cartoon. So, as a summer surprise, seeing this was not on my list of movies to see, I was pleasantly surprised.

","I watched Carrie again for the first time in years, having seen the trailer for the remake with Chloe thingybob from the god awful Kick Ass. Its a tragic tale about a shy girl called Carrie White who seems to get abuse and bullying by almost everyone she meets, her mother, classmates even annoying kids on bikes. Her mother is a religious nut case, therefore she has had no knowledge or understanding of the world and is left open to bullying from other kids due to the fact she is different. What no one knows is how different Carrie really is. She is already realising she can move things with her mind at the start of the movie, therefore its not dragged down with learning to use her 'powers' etc and instead concentrates on the story. For the story is not only about her ability, its an all too human tale of someone looking for acceptance, to be loved and its this that makes it so memorable. Its a very cruel movie for several reasons. First of all the bullying is quite nasty and humiliating, secondly then with help of one of the few sympathetic class mates Carrie gets her dream date for the prom (after initial scepticism) and during the prom she is genuinely happy for once in her life and these scenes are very touching. As a viewer we know its not going to end there however, we know the fall will come and DePalma expertly creates the ominous atmosphere before the bucket of blood comes crashing down all over her. What comes next is a split screen massacre as Carrie wipes out almost the entire Prom Night goers in a rage fuelled inferno. Carrie is a film that has that magic mix. DePalma's sure direction is excellent (even the quirky touches such as the fast forward work for me) Sissy Spacek, words are not enough to explain her shattering performance. It really is something.

While cinematography is important, French movies are often criticized for their overindulgence in angles without dialog. Finish a French movie and ask yourself, ""What did I just watch?""

Refusing to adopt a formulaic childhood movie friendship (animosity, followed by one person helping the other and then a flowering and transcendental relationship), Quentin and Bonnet seesaw between appreciation and apprehension. True to life, there is no single event that cements their friendship and instead several experiences grow the two closer together.The setting takes place in occupied France during World War II, which is a situation ideal for exploring the sheer range of human experience: trust and betrayal, love and hate, fear and courage, hope and hopelessness. However, the film doesn't try to do overextend itself and simply concentrates on the children. In fact, most of the situations that occur are not understood by Quentin. While he's sitting in class and the camera shows a German soldier asking to confess outside the window, he doesn't even look up from his school work. Then when his math class continues underground after an air raid siren, he nonchalantly ignores the teacher's lesson and reads a different book. When the lights flicker, the children act excited; when the teacher starts praying, the children follow out of habit instead of fear. Even though the audience has evidence the story occurs sometime during the occupation, the only way we can identify the precise year is near the end when the math instructor mentions the start of a Soviet offensive. And since that signals somewhere around six months before Paris is liberated, the hope for a happy ending looms somewhere in the future.The film proceeds somewhat direction less for a long time. This allows tension to flow from the audiences expectations that something should happen soon, although we're not sure what or how. We mostly watch boys enjoying a sheltered life, oblivious to the dire state of world affairs. The voice over at the end is especially memorable because the free-flowing story has no buildup to a climax and we only recognize that we witnessed the climax when the voice over starts. As the German officer continues calling names, we are led to believe the movie has led us to the names called. But it doesn't â€“ the events are mostly over.While it can be tedious watching a French movie tiptoe from one isolated incident to another, Au Revoir Les Enfants is absolutely amazing. Seeing children in movies that behave like children (naturally we're not surprised when students relentlessly harass the new kid) authenticates the experience of the characters far beyond the less believable golden heart child befriends new kid and receives rewards for their kindness. Witnessing world history from different eyes will hopefully serve enough interest to consider watching this movie yourself. - Erik Hagen",Au Revoir les Enfants 1987.csv
jluis1984,6,0,0,17-Oct-06," A nice surprise
","In 2003 a small book named ""The Devil Wears Prada"" by the then unknown author Lauren Weisberger, came out of nowhere and surprisingly reached the top of the New York Times bestseller list becoming the proof that this new genre fiction named ""chick lit"" was here to stay. However, more than its literary style, what made Weisberger's novel suddenly popular was the rumor that this fictional tale of an insanely capricious boss was based on the real life experience of its author while working in Vogue magazine under the rule of the editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour. Wheter Weisberger really based her book in Wintour is still open to debate (Weisberger denies it), but the book's huge popularity soon ensured a film adaptation, and the legendary actress Meryl Streep was the once chose to play the Devil dressed in Prada.The film is about young Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), who fresh from college, gets a job as personal assistant of Runway magazine editor, the legendary Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), famed for being a powerful influential figure in the fashion industry with little to no regard to those under her command. Andy, a complete foreigner to this environment, will have to put up with her eccentric boss and her insane capricious demands. To make things worse, as Andy begins to discover the industry she'll have to make choices, as her past life begins to feel incompatible with her new career.While the screenplay (by Aline Brosh McKenna) remains relatively close to the source novel, it's fair to point out that it has several (probably necessary) departures from the book's plot, making it a simplified version of the story. Still, the movie keeps the overall themes of the tyrannical boss and the choices of life, as well as the charm and freshness of Weisberger's book. However, due to this simplification of the plot, it becomes a bit predictable as it has a lot in common with many other similar films (""Swimming with Sharks"", 1994, for example) about a young newcomer being bullied by a mean boss.""The Devil Wears Prada"" is director David Frankel's first theatrical feature film, however, it's by no means his first important job, as Frankel perfected his craft directing several episodes of the famous TV series, ""Sex and the City"" (also inspired by a ""chick lit"" source). In many ways, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" retains the feeling of Frankel's previous work and it's probably the obvious next step in his career. While it may not be the most original film ever, it has quite good features, such as a very good edition (by Mark Livolsi) and a well-selected soundtrack.Many words have been written about Meryl Streep's excellent performance, so I'll just say that she was perfect for the role, as she gives a deeper, more complex personality to a character that essentially exist to be mean. While Streep's performance is essentially what makes the film to stand out from other similar movies, credit must also go to Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt, who play Miranda's two main assistants. Hathaway as our main character, Andy, delivers a quiet, subtle performance that allows her character to be likable, specially as her actions begin to show the slow but constant effect that Miranda has in her. Emily Blunt is the film's best surprise, showing a great future and a big talent for comedy. Finally, Stanley Tucci has a minor role, but shows off his scene-stealing abilities and makes gold of every moment he appears on screen. The rest of the cast is quite effective, but nothing really as special as the four main characters.Personally, I think that the film's worst problem is the many similarities it shares with other films, as it gives the feeling that the story lacks originality. However, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" makes up for this flaw with its light-hearted tone and its big charm, as it's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously (as other similar films do). Also, Frankel's past directing a TV series becomes too notorious at times, making the film look like an extended chapter of a TV series; however, this is not really as annoying as it sounds, and it's probably due to the act that this is Frankel's first feature film.""The Devil Wears Prada"" is quite a good film for a nice evening, it's charming, funny, and most importantly: entertaining. It's always a joy to watch a very talented actress at work, but it's also a joy to discover three new talents (Hathaway, Blunt and director David Frankel) having a chance and making a good job. It may not be a life-changing experience, but this devil is a nice surprise. 6/10",The Devil Wears Prada 2006.csv

","These people who say that ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" is crap are the same people who sad that the original ""Matrix"" was garbage and believe me, there were many of these people. There is a difference in the reasoning of this, though. With the first one, people were expecting garbage, so that's all they chose to see. Now that ""The Matrix"" has achieved such high status in pop culture and become so critically acclaimed, they like it because they knew there had to be something good in there and now they see it. With the first long-awaited sequel, ""The Matrix: Reloaded"", any bit of straying from the original formula will result in so-called disappointment. What the Wachowskis have done, in typical brilliant fashion, is defy all formulaic conventionalities of the sequel, where the same story is simply used over again and stretched out beyond boredom and predictability. They have completely changed the face of the Matrix universe and in huge plot twists, altered everything you think you know. We come to the movies to be surprised, don't we? What fun would ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" be if all the humans do is free more minds and do more kung-fu simulations and in the end, Neo discovers that all we need to do is dump water on the machines and cause them to short-circuit? The tagline of the movie, ""Free Your Mind"" was a message for the audience to throw their expectations out the window. I have to admit, when I first saw the movie, I thought, ""What the hell? This is too convoluted and too much!"" But I was wrong as multiple viewings of ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" continue to be fascinating, thought provoking, and brilliantly noodle-cooking. This is truly the most re-watchable movie ever made. Many things are still ambiguous, but I consider this just one half of one really long sequel, so I expect things to be all wrapped up, come November.

","Martin Scorsese has always been the Jewel of New Hollywood, he hasn't burned out like Coppola & Cimino, or softened his image by making giant block busters and family films like Spielberg and Lucas. Even his 2011 film Hugo, while a departure from his normal dark crime films still contained his trademark love of all things cinema. So how did his new film ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" ad to his legacy? Well quite frankly we've seen this story before, actually we've seen it twice before in his crime masterpiece Goodfellas, and his chilling biopic (and possible greatest film) Raging Bull. The story of a young hot headed male ( Jordan Belfort, Henry Hill, Jake LaMotta) who starts humble while sinking deeper in their respective world (the corruption of Wall Street, the Italian-American Mafia, or Boxing title fights) is a world Scorsese can tell about growing up in the Machismo rich culture of Italian-American New York. But while each re-telling has seen Scorsese improve his technique and the art of the camera, each successive film has become more sterile. Viewing Raging Bull to this day still is a cinematic art piece that shows the negative consequences of the brutal male psyche, and then in Goodfellas, while Henry Hill follows the same path his character is not one to be sympathized much with, and then finally Jordan Belfort, a character that is as smug and unlikable, but is un-noticed when placed in a film with even more unlikeable characters (looking right at Jonah Hill). None of the characters in this film through the plot even allow you to empathize with them draining the film (with a run time of over 2 hours) of any compassion and only leaving the audience in disgust (especially in the current economic recession, not too many want to see the hubris of Stock Brokers). A Dark comedy, the film offers very few actual laughs, and for all the sex going on the background, none of it is actually sexy, just extravagant and over the top. If it were not for Martin Scorsese being the director I probably wouldn't be rating this film as highly . Not to take from Scorsese as I personally love many of his films (Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Casino) and with a resume like his he's allowed to make a few good movies opposed to great ones, which is exactly how to describe The Wolf of Wall Street.",The Wolf of Wall Street 2013.csv

jon2005,9,8,11,22-May-06," Spider-Man 2
","No one can deny that 2002's Spider-Man was excellent. It had everything that was required for a top superhero film Â– great characters, great script, great action and great effects. The story of the all-too-human Peter Parker who, because of a freak accident (aren't they all?!) became Spider-Man, and after the death of his uncle decides to heed his advice and fulfil his responsibility to protect people with his new-found powers. Of course, the Green Goblin showed up to mess things up, but it all worked out (reasonably) well in the end.To write a synopsis for the sequel, I could just settle for ""see above"". The story behind this film is pretty much the same as the original, but then again when the result is this good, a 'more of the same' attitude is not necessarily a bad thing. There are obviously going to be some changes, and this time Peter begins to lose his powers instead of gaining them. This gives a nice little twist to the story, and also provides most of the films lighter moments (Spider-Man taking the lift to get down from a building), and throughout this shows how comfortable director Sam Raimi is with his source material. Also fully present and correct is the good-hearted scientist who, because of an experiment gone wrong, becomes a mad bad-guy. However Alfred Molina must be given credit, as he is a much better villain than the Green Goblin was (and not a stupid mask in sight!), giving the right amount of menace to the film; he almost steals the show from right under Tobey Maguire's web. The rest of the cast are also excellent, their characters evolving just as you would expect them to after the first film.However, unfortunately it cannot be said that the sequel is actually better than the original; it is clearly its equal, even though has better acting, better effects and a better villain. The problem comes slap-bang in the middle of the film, just after Peter has decided to give up being Spider-Man and start his life afresh. The set up becomes repetitive Â– his powers fail him in exactly the same way (in mid-air) a total of four times. He even goes into a burning building just like last time to save a kid; though this time he is without his powers. Once he gives up his responsibilities, the film seems to dip into some kind of soap, with Peter trying to win Mary-Jane back. This results in some quite trite dialogue, and the whole act is far too long, prompting the audience to have doubts as to where this is all going.But it is all saved by a relentless final act, where Spider-Man realises he has to do what he does, and goes to kick some ass. And does he! The action scenes beat the originals' hands-down, and special mention must go to the showdown on the train, which is accelerating out of control. They are expertly shot and edited, giving any other film of 2004 a run for its money in the excitement stakes. It's non-stop pace is just what the film needs after the slow middle section, and it clearly shows that this franchise is definitely going somewhere great. If only that middle had a little more attention paid to it, then this could have quite possibly been a 10. However because of this, and it's 'more of the same' feel, no matter how good it might be, just puts the top score out of reach.Rated: 9/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",Spider-Man 2 2004.csv

","**spoiler alert**The most genius part about this movie is that it was a ""Black Comedy"". I'm sure that the memoirs were not meant to be a comedy but Scorsese made the right call. i can see that such a story might be very controversial if it was done as a biography-drama, as it is being told by one side of the story who is the bad guy. people will start saying (and they are already)that the movie celebrate this criminal. but if you would forget for a moment that it is a real story, i think most of us will agree that it was hilarious and fun to watch. and this is what the movie is all about. its about a con artist who scammed people and did so many bad things and finally he was able to have a happy ending (not fair but true).what i most like about this movie is that it is one of those movies which show us the inside of a situation and make us more aware. this movie did not show us the effect he had on his victims but it showed us the strategies these brokers pull to get a commission. whenever a sales person call me now i will probably imagine him doing what DeCaprio was doing when he was convincing that man to buy from him (when he was teaching his employees how to close a deal).

Minus some less than stellar acting (in fact, its horrible) and some just as bad dialogue, I really thought that maybe this film could pull it off. Disturbing death scenes ensue.Then, bring in Mark Wahlberg. What happened to this guy? Nominated for an Oscar for his turn in The Departed, Wahlberg seems like a safe bet, but in actuality, he's playing a role that just isn't made for him. This role was made for someone nicer. Walhberg has been typecast time and time again as the angry and bad-ass guy, and now I see why. He's good at that and god awful at being nice.No one else is particularly good either. Zoey Deschanel disappoints, John Leguizamo (Everyone in this movie has a name that's difficult to spell), and all of the extras are just as bad. There is not a single moment of good acting in this movie.And all of that is because of how rushed this film feels. This is one of those movies that it seriously felt like the director was working on a very limited budget and then took the first take for every actor, none of them had a chance to get into their roles (or so I hope).It's obvious who will get all of the blame for this (M. Night Shyamalan) and it's really too bad. I can't say that the plot is necessarily bad, it isn't, and with maybe one more draft the script would've been good. The faults of this film all land on Night's shoulders though.

Not so much for how bad it actually is (it's very bad) but because I really had faith in the director. The trailers almost felt promising and Shyamalan (am I even spelling this right?) promised me that I'd walk out shaking.

It is extremely shaky and seems unprofessional (done in order to create a chaotic feel to the movie?). Because of the camera I became nauseous when watching the film and I seriously had to close my eyes for a couple of minutes because I couldn't stand the way the camera view was shaking heavily.. I don't know how many people will have the same as I did but I will certainly not watch the movie again, just because of the poor camera.If it would've contained steady footage etc it would have gotten an 8, but since I believe the camera is sh*t, I'm giving the movie a 6.Hope you find this useful.",United 93 2006.csv

","Trekkie purists the world over will probably be trying to fathom out where this fits into their tidy little space time line for some time to come but, what the hell, it was the best two hour romp through space I've had in a long time!! Resurrecting such an icon of TV and cinema and taking it back to its very beginnings was never going to be an easy task but hats have to come off to this cast and crew, they have done a magnificent job.Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto were outstanding, each slotting into their role and maintaining many of the mannerisms of their predecessors. Karl Urban opened my eyes with his almost faultless recreation of DeForest Kelley's 'Bones' McCoy. Simon Pegg gave us a new, but highly enjoyable, take on Chief Engineer 'Scotty' and the rest of the core crew were equally magnificent (Including Chekov who was way out of his time line.) The inclusion of a Spock from the future, played (as excellently as ever) by Leonard Nimoy, was an interesting twist, as was the concurrent Spock's romantic involvement with Lt. Uhura. Getting Mrs Roddenbery's buy in by giving back her old job as a computer voice was a master stroke as well. From the other end, Eric Bana gave a very creditable performance as the Romulan 'Baddie', Nero.What is clear is that this has been split off as a separate time line from The Original Series so certain discrepancies, not least Captain Pike's, can be quietly ignored.So, did I enjoy it? Absolutely!!! Would I like to see a run of these films? Bring 'em on!!! Maybe they could even take one or two of the original story lines and bring them up to date their own way.",Star Trek 2009.csv

As is explained this guys were able to convinced the wealthy guy to go there with no more argument that the paintings and a Hunch from one of the archaeologist. pretty weak reason I said.Dialog were bad, specially Theron's one, she is not able to perform as the bad one, she is not able to set the necessary tension between the eagerness to investigate and her personal ambitions.

","Shrek is a 'fairytale' with all the traditional ingredients - a princess locked in a tower, a hero on a quest to save her, a scheming villain, true love leading to a happy (if somewhat unexpected) ending, and a supporting cast including everyone from a delightfully French Robin Hood to the gingerbread man.  However, Shrek is certainly not a traditional fairytale.  For a start, the hero is, by his own admission, a big, smelly, ugly ogre. Secondly, this is not only a movie for kids - much of the humour will only be fully appreciated by adults.  And Shrek will have *everyone* smiling, giggling and laughing out loud.  All of the characters have their funny and memorable quotes and scenes, but the best lines come from Donkey (although occasionally he seems to be trying just a little too hard for comic effect). The computer animation is stunning and with a just a little imagination you can see that the characters somewhat resemble the actors who provide their voices.  There is definitely a bit of Eddie Murphy in Donkey anyway.  It is perhaps the attention to detail that is most impressive - the facial expressions are just fabulous.   Shrek is a must-see film, because almost everyone will find something to like about it (although perhaps not those who like their fairy tales to be predictable and perfect).

","With the admonition, ""I never liked the bitch anyway,"" the Willie character in the new DS dispatched my favorite Dark Shadows character, pretty much summing up Depp and Burton's apparent opinion of her. For me, Dark Shadows was about Julia and Barnabas. Their chemistry created the dynamic that made the show work for me. I'm not only a first- generation DS fan, I'm the co-author of the Dark Shadows Companion. Johnny Depp, supposedly a first-generation fan, even though he's two years younger than I am and I'm supposedly very young for a first generation fan, apparently thinks Barnabas Collins is part moral icon, part victim of his crotch. I wonder if Depp was watching the same series I was. As much as I loved the original Barnabas, I see no trace of the character in his interpretation. Frankly, the minute he murdered Julia, the whole movie collapsed for me -- the implied oral sex scene was bad enough, but the killing finished it. In the House of Dark Shadows big-screen remake this was accepted by fans because the series was still on-going. Depp does not have that salvation.I really don't care that she's alive for the sequel. I doubt there will be a sequel. If there is, it's still not the characters I grew up with. However, we're supposed to be reviewing what the film is, not what it's not. What it is, is an overstuffed suitcase that somebody sat on in order to zip it shut. It spills out all over everywhere. The cohesiveness is forced. The characters are largely unrecognizable. As I watched the film, I was at first taken by the wonderful graphics, but Collinwood seemed to morph into Disneyland's Haunted Mansion.There are some good performances, it's occasionally slightly funny, it's graphically intense and interesting, but Depp and Burton seem to have nothing but contempt for the original series.

","This is a thriller and a very good one at that so I don't want to give away too much of this movie in this review (particularly since I do not like putting 'spoiler alert' in any of my reviews).Anyway, Dr Martin Harris awakes in a hospital after a particularly nasty car accident, and realises that his wife is probably worried that she hasn't heard from him for a few days. So, he discharges himself from the hospital and rushes over to the hotel to discover there is somebody else there who claims to be Dr Harris, and his wife has no idea who he is. Thus the adventure begins.As you wander through this movie your mind is constantly trying to come to a rational explanation as to what is going on. I thought that it must involve clones or something, but that just did not sit right since it was clear that this was not a science-fiction movie, despite the movie revolving around a bio-genetics conference that Dr Harris is attending.The main theme behind this movie is identity. Who are we truly, and what is it that defines who we are. It is certainly not our name, since others can have the same name as ourselves, but be vastly different. Is it a case of identity theft? Unlikely because Dr Harris' wife does not recognise him, despite him remembering their honeymoon. Is it our friends, or our occupation, that defines us? Not entirely, since Dr Harris' wife does not recognise him, and the other Dr Harris appears to be as much of an expert in the field as the protagonist does.As I said, I do not want to give away too much about this movie because it is a really good thriller, and in the end everything is explained in a rational and logical manner.

Moments like these are the ones in which I miss the innocence of childhood. Where wicked things were unbeknownst to us. Life moves fast, and this is a whopper of a freeze frame. Acting: 10/10Each actor gives a heart filled performance, and wisely, no big actors were cast in the film. Big actors would have ruined it, making it a horrible attempt at capturing real people. Oliver Stone really, REALLY, should have taken a note of that.Writing: 10/10Though this wasn't exactly ""written"" per say, it was pieced together well. Directing: 10/10Paul Greengrass takes material and treats it with fatherly care. I will forever respect him for his lovingly crafted portrayal of disaster.Cinematography: 10/10 I gave Greengrass a horrible time for his horrible hand-held camera work in his previous Bourne Supremacy, and now I swear he must have come across my words as he has done much better this time around. Bravo on the improvement, and especially on that ending shot!Special Effects: As far as my well trained eye could tell, none to be had.So in the end, this leaved me with the feeling I can only describe as fulfillment.

samseescinema,8,3,6,19-May-06," isn't the best adaptation The Da Vinci Code fanatics could've hoped for, but a solid flick
","rating: 3 out of 4After nearly three years of putting it off, last week I finally picked up and read The Da Vinci Code. Being the 40,000,001st person to read the book wasn't much fun, as a dozen or more people giddily peered over my shoulder, asking what page I was on and oh-so-accidentally letting the twists slip off their tongues. I figured that since all the other 40,000,000 people who've read the book will view the film adaptation in a gnawing, nit picky book-to-film comparison, I probably should too. Trying to review a film from a perspective no one in the theatre will have has never been a winning stratagem. And Dan Brown's book was fun and riling, utilizing convincing art history and extremist theology to thicken its otherwise pulpy tale. As a film, its prospects were titillating: the damned thing was pretty much written to be a movie in the first place. But when put to practice, some key elements were lost in translation. Granted, Ron Howard is a more eloquent storyteller than Dan Brown, utilizing the language of film with more agility than Brown can maneuver the English language; but the script lost something along the way: for all its length, Mr. Howard's The Da Vinci Code has lost its scholarly charm.Now don't go running off thinking Hollywood's done it again; this is a respectful adaptation that constricts its creativity to stay true to the worldwide literary phenomenon. What I mean is that Akiva Goldsman's adaptation seems to rush itself in some of the wrong places. For those of you who're like me and have somehow avoided the book for the last years, here's a little synopsis: a respected curator for the Louvre is found dead with a mysterious smattering of clues surrounding his body. Symbologist and Cryptologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) track these clues down to their historical significance, tromping around Paris and London in search of the Holy Grail, the curator's controversial secret. Going any more in depth is a waste of print-space. I was the only person who hadn't read the book anyhow.The finest moments of the novel, most will admit, occurred when Langdon and Neveu sifted through their encyclopedic knowledge in search of solutions to their international, multi-millennial treasure hunt. We were educated as they whittled down the answers, introduced to stifling theories and tasty little factoids. But with the film adaptation, Mr. Howard seems to skim over the puzzling aspects of the hunt. Answers seem to simply pop into the characters heads. Oh sure, every once in a while an anagram gives them a few seconds of trouble, but Mr. Sauniere's (the curator) brilliance is never properly honored. The trail he laid for the pair was intricate in the novel, laden with double entendres and charmed solutions. Goldsman's script doesn't have time for such nonsense, floating along past these magical moments of scholarly adventure and replacing them instead with other conversations lifted from the text that offer up disappointing substitutes. Beyond this, however, I have no quibble with the project. Put simply, it's the moving picture version of the book we read, but without the clunky sentences. The best people in the business were put on this project and it certainly shows. Not only does Ron Howard prove yet again his careful command of the film medium, but the casting is also watertight. Mr. Hanks and Ms. Tautou strike the chord of off-kilter chemistry that Mr. Brown aimed for in his book, while the ghostly Silas is haunting and pathetic in the form of Paul Bettany. And yes, despite Hanks' much abused hairdo, his performance is the most respectful of all. He's just fine as Robert Langdon.And there's no need to worry about the screenplay taking its own creative liberties. The one major change from the book is well handled and probably a better choice anyhow (it has to do with Captain Fache and Bishop Aringarosa). There are little things changed too, but only shifted to speed up Mr. Brown's otherwise sloppy action sequences. Instead of Sophie hitting the brakes and calmly driving away from the tightly guarded U.S. Embassy, she embarks on a wild, backwards car chase in the deeply congested streets of Paris. Ron Howard knows how to drive his film in these scenes, and his control of The Da Vinci Code is its winning token. This isn't the best adaptation The Da Vinci Code fanatics could've hoped for, but it's a solid flick. The eloquence Mr. Howard delivers is a vast improvement over Mr. Brown's fumbling language, while Brown's adventure is undermined by Howard's slighting of the treasure hunt. This is a fair trade, sure, but it prevents both works from achieving greatness.",The Da Vinci Code 2006.csv

s_campanale,7,4,7,02-Apr-11," Original and Bold but maybe not what audiences wanted
","Many have proffered their own interpretations, and this is just my own.As many have said, I believe the film is all a fantasy taking place in ""Sweet Peas"" head, a cathartic fantasy designed to help her expunge her demons and overcome her psychological problems, perhaps with the aid of a counsellor/therapist (The Carla Gugino character?) What these ""traumas"" may be is unclear, but they probably involve sexual violence and or/guilt, and the accidental death/harm of a younger sister, since this same act occurs twice in the movie, both in romanticised ""dying to protect from harm"" scenarios. Her desire to return home though may mean that the violence of the films many stereotyped sexual predators may be external to the family unit (Date rape?) Many seem to take it for granted that the ""50s Asylum"" level of reality is the ultimate ""reality"", but I suggest that it too is just another fantasy level â€“ being just as much a caricatured surreal demi-world as the Burlesque theatre or the WWI battlefields â€“ which explains why so many things that happen there don't make sense. I believe that, as with some interpretations of INCEPTION, the whole thing is being concocted in some other layer of reality which we never get to see. Also people complain that aside from Sweet Pea and her sister Rocket, none of the other characters are fleshed out or real, which would support this interpretation since Sweet Pea is her own avatar, while her sister (idealised version?) is made from many genuine memories of a real person, whereas the others are just shades, faces from a crowd given a generic role to play. All of the girls (bar Rocket) are elements of Sweet Peas own personality, actresses in her cathartic experience. Each has a role to play, and it was interesting for example that in each fantasy, ""Amber"" is the pilot, a role usually evoking control, but not much was made of it.""Baby Doll"" who is erroneously introduced to us as the heroine (Which she is, even though she does not exist!) is Sweet Peas own personal guardian angel (as per the narratives). As many have said, she seems to have almost no character, no lines, no expressions and looks oddly like a doll. I believe that she may actually very well be just that â€“ A Doll! Perhaps a beloved childhood companion, someone to protect and to give comfort during the dark times, a mouthpiece for her own desires and wants (her role here..) and someone would could be put into danger (as dolls often are) as she is here. She is a safety valve to at once remove Sweet Pea from her own perils and anxieties, now given full human form to become once again Sweet Peas ""other voice"" and the heroine of her adventure, her saviour. Her symbolic ""death"" at the end, rather than the expected rescue and revenge, may also represent the death of childhood and innocence, and the Sweet Peas acceptance of her role as an adult (and her return to her milieu as an adult) This fantasy world created by Snyder is, to his credit, an authentically adolescent one, a credible window into a how a teenager would see the world, and a modern one at that. Her fantasies are actually rather mundane and pedestrian (another popular complaint) and also all second hand and acquired. The World War 1 sequence is exactly how a teenager might imagine the war, all Zeppelins and Fokker Triplanes, with a ""good vs evil"" idea of the conflict that makes the Germans into literal monsters (rather like the imagined Persians in 300) The Samurai scene and the girls uniforms are all borrowed from Manga, the dragon scene is unashamedly the result of someone who has been excitedly reading/watching ""THE LORD OF THE RINGS"", and the final scene of ticking bombs and evil robots another movie/computer game take, also a way of reliving her sister tragedy within generically comfortable boundaries. Even the Asylum and the Burlesque are what someone who had been watching the odd old movie might imagine those worlds to be like, with their stock baddies, bad doctors and Zoot Suit gangsters. Sex is also a central theme here, the fear of sex (sexual predators), the power of her own burgeoning sexuality (the dances) and the threat/possible experience of sexual violence. The twin threats her Baby Doll avatar faces, deflowering and Lobotomisation, are both distinctly phallic threats involving forced penetration, again mirroring a fear of sex (That her Baby Doll actually is lobotomised and seemingly invites it would again suggest acceptance of sex) The Glenn wise man is a clear mythopoetic ""guide"" and may be either a kindly uncle or teacher, or perhaps even her own father. The finale, still a fantasy, shows her accepting her return home as a fully formed young woman, having overcome her fears and doubts and possible terrible experiences, with the most oft used metaphor, the bus (driven by her protecting father figure)/ That's my take on it anyway. It may be right, part right, or totally wrong, but I guess Snyder wants us each to have our own ""correct"" personal interpretation of it, hence the ambiguity. That the film is initially proving a box office and critical bomb is unsurprising, and will probably spend a few years in the wilderness before being ""re-evaluated"" as all greats are. Alas this film is being currently sold as an action packed Saturday day adventure, when it's really a dark, somewhat joyless journey through a tormented teenagers angst, and audiences are perhaps rightly feeling cheated",Sucker Punch 2011.csv

I admit I haven't read the book by Diana Wynne Jones, but this film is so imaginative and delightful I doubt I would have cared if it was unfaithful to the book or not. The animation here is amazing, the backgrounds are gorgeous and the colours so bright. Plus the castle itself was a wonder to behold. The visual style here also has a certain elegance about it, and the atmosphere the visuals create is somewhat meticulous. I also have to mention the score, it was absolutely stunning. Beautiful, magical and poignant themes that caressed my ears, like a Mozart opera would. The characters are engaging and are beautifully voiced by a terrific voice cast. Christian Bale's(not a stranger to voice work, he voiced Thomas in Disney's Pocahontas as well) seductive and silky voice brings vain wizard Howl to vivid life, and Sophie is a very lovable and beautiful character, whether in her younger form or her older form. Her younger form is sensitively voiced by Emily Mortimer and her older self is voiced by the late Jean Simmons with real sincerity. The Witch of the Waste is a character consumed by jealousy, so much so it results in Sophie's transformation from a young 18 year old girl to a pensioner. This character is perfectly voiced by screen legend Lauren Bacall. Billy Crystal is a joy to behold as Calcifer, one of my favourite characters in the film, and Turniphead was very intriguing as well. The story is a sweet, timeless imaginative one, not the best written one by all means, but it did touch me a lot. Did I notice anything wrong? Yes, but these flaws are minor compared to the overall beauty of the film. The final third is a little too rushed, and the ending is a little over-surreal.

johno-21,8,1,2,28-Feb-07," The Virgin Queen
","A film by a director from India staring an actress from Australia in a story about one of Britain's most well-known monarchs. But hey, it works. This is a lavish costume drama of a semi-historical account of the Ascension to the thrown and the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I. Henry VIII is the second Tudor king and after his death his son the Protestant Edward VI becomes a boy king but dies as a teenager. Edward's cousin, the Catholic Jane Grey becomes the regent queen for nine days and is executed and the Catholic Mary I who is the daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon becomes Queen. Mary in the five years of her reign earns the title of Bloody Mary for executing more people than had been executed in the previous century and a half. Childless, she dies of ovarian cancer and her half sister, the Protestant Elizabeth who is the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, becomes Queen Elizabeth I also known as Gloriana, Good Queen Bess and the Virgin Queen. Elizabeth is also the sixth and last Tudor monarch. This film is filled with castle intrigue, the fight for power, and the religious clash between Protestants and Catholics in a post Henry VIII and post Reformation world. Cate Blanchette who had only appeared in a handful of films won acclaim for her staring role in the film Oscar & Lucinda is cast in the title role of Elizabeth which earned her her first Academy Award nomination. This film has a great ensemble cast. Joseph Fiennes is Robert Dudley the Earl of Leicester and Eliabeth's true love interest. Geoffry Rush is Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's spy master and adviser. Christopher Eccleston is Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, one of the most powerful men in England. Richard Attenborough is Sir William Cecil, Scretary of State and Elizabeth's chief adviser. Fanny Ardant is Mary of Guise the Queen Consort of Scotland who also seeks the throne of England. Vincent Cassel is Duc d'Anjou who is being considered as a possible husband for Elizabeth. Kathy Burke is Queen Mary Tudor who hates her half sister Elizabeth and once had Elizabeth imprisoned in the Tower. John Gielgud, in his final film, has a very brief on screen role as The Pope. The film can be a little confusing as it takes a dramatic license with history and tries to fit too much into a two hour run time. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Original Score, Best Art Direction and Best Makeup winning only the Oscar for makeup. Shekhar Kapur directs a script by Michael Hirst with beautiful cinematography by Remi Adelfarasin. John Myhre and Peter Howitt create stunning sets in art and set decoration and Alexandra Byrne designs elaborate period piece costumes. Jenny Shircore wins the film's only Oscar for makeup but had this not been up against some other particularly strong films for 1998 it would have won more. Director Kapur, cinematographer Adelfarasin and writer Michael Hirst have reunited for the sequel The Golden Age with Blanchette reprising her role as Elizabeth and Rush back as Walsingham.

Shed those lofty expectations however, and an exceptional sci-fi thriller remains. Setting the tone early with a disintegrating death to a sorta-human-sorta-alien creature, writers Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts revel in ambiguity for the first two acts â€“ drip-feeding information here and there, often in subtle ways requiring maximum attention from the audience â€“ before unleashing a more mainstream finale that feels slightly bloated, although never-the-less captivating thanks to the sublime visuals. And it's with the memorable images that this motion picture scores highest; every frame is littered with something impressive to look at, subsequently immersing the viewer into this world entirely and gliding over the occasional odd character decision or plot contrivance. Ridley has clearly not lost his nerve when it comes to confronting scenes either, a key sequence featuring a nerve-wracking emergency operation is chillingly effective and possibly the standout moment in the film. As for the cast, they are all given their moment to shine and no-one lets the team down (although Guy Pierce is covered in so much elderly make-up it becomes distracting), however Michael Fassbender is in a league of his own as the eerie and highly-affecting droid David.

I myself am a big SK fan but a lot of his movies turn out to be crap, but Darabont really has the touch. This is probably the best SK horror film I've seen (better than the Shining) and second only to Shawshank. This film is unpredictable with many twists and turns and possibly the most shocking ending I have seen in a long time.The cast in movie is spectacular, Thomas Jane may not be to well known but he does a great job playing the hero. Marcia Gay Harden is definitely my favorite, the audience actually applauded when she died. Andre Bruagher may not be in the movie for long but in the short time he is there he does an excellent job. Toby Jones and Willam Saddler's performances just made my day.This movie was better than I had expected and I already had high hopes. This great writing, great acting and most of all a great story makes it a great movie.",The Mist 2007.csv
Mobius_loop,1,4,5,26-Dec-11," Liked Chris Pine, hated the nonsensical script
","First off, I thought Chris Pine did a great job as Kirk. He seemed to be channeling Shatner's Kirk (in a good way) with a really visceral physicality. That being said...as a reboot this destroys virtually the entire back-history of the series (except for Enterprise which predates it). I know this is an ALTERNATE history, but this isn't an adequate excuse for the mush the critics seem to love. I found the camera work impossible to follow and extremely jarring. The plot made absolutely no sense. OK the Romulans are P****d off at Spock for not being able to save their planet, but instead of getting hold of the time travel device to SAVE their world they go off on a revenge binge...come on. How stupid are these people? Shouldn't they now be able to change history and PREVENT the disaster in the first place? The whole Spock and Kirk in conflict just did not ring true. Spock loses his temper and orders Kirk thrown off the ship? Just weird. Can you imagine this happening in a military command today? Thrown in the brig yes, but OFF THE SHIP??? NUTS. While I don't mind stretching the science aspect once in a while to make the plot work, transporting across interstellar distances was impossible in the Star Trek universe 100 years later. So Scotty can on the fly just pop them into the Enterprise engine room? I'm a big Simon Pegg fan, and I liked him as Scotty, but the script he was given just didn't work for the character. I can say the same for all the other characters. They just did not come alive for me the way they did in the original series. McCoy already had his quirks, all the catchphrases were duly said, but it was rather empty. My final and biggest complaint is how can you wipe out the Vulcans? One of the most popular races in the ST universe. I might have been able to forgive this reboot if they had simply not done this one thing. The writers had to have one REALLY BIG difference between this and the original, so they decide to blow up Vulcan...DUMB. I have no intention of bothering with any more movies in this rebooted series. I'm sure they will make money with the new fans who never watched the original, but I'm willing to bet they lost a bunch of us TOS fans...not that the producers care I'm sure.",Star Trek 2009.csv

","The Matrix was one of the finest pieces of cinema when it was released by Warner Brothers in 1999, and for four long years myself, and the rest of the world it seems, have waited with baited breath for the two sequels.  The Matrix Reloaded is an absolutely stunning picture and I dare anyone to go the cinema and not enjoy it.  The action sequences are amongst the best ever put to celluloid and the storyline which has left so many scratching their heads, will I believe, make more sense after repeated viewings, and will be put straight when Revolutions reaches our shores in November.Perhaps it didn't have the same effect as the first film because we knew what to expect but it is still a brilliant film.  A must see for anyone who watched the first film and was amazed by its originality and storyline.

","I've been an IMDb member for about 5 years or so and I've rated over 650 titles. I never wrote a review before though...""Drive"" is the most overrated movie I have ever seen. When I got out of the cinema the other night I was outraged. But not in the ""I want my money back!"" or ""I want my two hours back!"" way. I was outraged because this movie is rated higher than ""Leon"", for example. I can name a hundred movies that are better than ""Drive"" but have lower ratings. In my opinion it's a 6/10 movie. Full of clichÃ©s, weak plot, no dialogue and uncalled for explicit violence scenes. The cinematic was good and the soundtrack was OK, but that doesn't add up. Everybody is talking about the acting. Well, what acting? There are no characters, not even one line of dialogue to be remembered. Ryan Gosling acts like he is the most awesome person in the universe. Moving around with his hands in his pockets or with his arms crossed on his chest, with a toothpick in his mouth like he's Stallone in ""Cobra"". A man of few words but who looks smarter than anybody else. He is ridiculous taking himself so seriously. But hey, he is a mechanic, part time stunt driver, part time get-away driver. How cool is that? Maybe he should have also applied for a school bus driver position so his sensitive side appear more clear to us and soften our dull old hearts.And what's with all that violence? Broken skulls, throats cut, blood everywhere all of a sudden. These scenes just don't fit in the movie. It seems that they were added just to shock the audience and to impress the 12 year-old who managed to get tickets. And don't get me started on the screenplay flaws...Anyway, there are so many things that I didn't like in this movie that they wouldn't fit in 10 reviews. I believe though that his rating will eventually go down. I mean, 8.7? Lets have some sense. That's how ""Matrix"", ""The usual suspects"" or ""Forrest Gump"" are rated... ""Drive"" is just a ""B"" movie and doesn't deserve to share the spot with any other film above. Unless, the world turns upside down.EDIT: OK, I was a bit out of line regarding the title of my review. It's just a highly overrated movie.",Drive 2011.csv

","So honestly I was so anticipating this movie that I had broken the cardinal rule and looked at ratings and even skimmed the first couple pages of reviews on here and the interesting thing is most times the figures and the reviews coincide. However this time that certainly wasn't the case and I can tell you honestly that did not alter my review or even skew it in any way. I have no idea how this movie got such a high score but it isn't true by any meansThis movie was overall boring and very predictable... I went there opening day along with a work morale event. Now if I'd paid for my ticket I would have been even more disappointment. As it was I was overall very unsatisfied and expected much more from Ridley Scott. Hell even Legend which was much more of a bomb than this had so much more to offer. There was absolutely no suspense at all but more importantly as a Sci-Fi (and I'm a total Sci-Fi guy) from the start I was never reeled in at all, not once as it was just so flat. I felt like I was in a seat at a theater bored out of my skull and at one point I looked down at my phone to discover I was an hour into the movie and debated about walking out as it was that boring. However I stuck it out because I had nothing better to do than go back to work (tough choice huh). So I stuck it out and the second half wasn't any more suspenseful or action packed than the first half and I really felt let down on this flick as I was so looking forward to it. Talk about missing the mark.. Great job Ridley, you flubbed t his one up big time...The suspense or tension was obsolete. The acting was nothing memorable other than the captain of the ship whom I don't even know who he was. the two main big stars (Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender) were flatter than flat although Michael was decent I suppose for his android role he was given, but seriously they could have given away Charlize's role to some other lesser paid actor as her role was so wooden and stone cold that there was really no dimension or acting ability there.So other reviews had mentioned the spectacular effects and IMHO I didn't think they were at all that notable at all, which was the films other saving grace. nothing from the ship, the planet, the atmosphere, the tunnels, nothing at all left me going ""ahhhh..."" So in the end this movie IMHO fell flat on it's face. The co-workers that I went with gave it a little more than I but not much. This is by no means a gem and should a sequel be done it should not be directed by Ridley who as far as I'm concerned was a well respected director who apparently doesn't have the juice anymore.

There's a bunch of ideas thrown together in hope that somehow they will make a good story. The more I think about it the more I realize that ""Iron man 2"" had only one real purpose â€“ introduce Natasha that will be important in the ""Avengers"" movie. Ironically , her presence here is pretty much pointless (except looking pretty and some action near the end of movie).The movie doesn't know what to do with it's characters. Ivan Vankow and Justin Hammer who were supposed to be main villains don't really do anything through entire movie. Vankow has two fight scenes and that's it . For the rest of movie he is constructing a weapon , while Hammer just waits. Vankow isn't one bit interesting or scary character. His motivation to attack Stark doesn't have any real importance to overall story. The writer could also do much more with Justin Hammer.The performances are good with the exception of Scarlett Johansson and Don Cheadle. Johansson is boring , while Don Cheadle is very stiff. I missed Terence Howard . The plot is thin with some plot holes. I also couldn't buy the new element. I know this is a comic book movie , but that was just stupid.""Iron man 2"" is a disappointing sequel. The thin story is saved by the humor and brilliant special effects. The movie was obviously enjoyable enough to be a box office success. The next movie was even dumber than this one despite a more serious attempt at writing a story.

","*Dog Day SPOILERS* In 1972, Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) robbed a bank with two accomplices, one of which ran away soon after the beginning, and the other being Sal (John Cazale).The reason was getting enough money to permit to Leon Shermer (Chris Sarandon), Sonny's lover, to have the sex-change operation he needs, but what was intended to be a quick 'in-and-out' soon morphs into a hostage situation.The strange thing? The hostages are barely forced to do anything; Sonny actually cares for them - asks for food, calls for aspirines and a doctor when two of them fall ill... you really end up caring for the hostages and for the robbers, to the point where, when the 'happy end' arrives you can't help but feel bad for what happens to Sonny and Sal.Based on a true story, this movie, directed by Sidney Lumet, whose genius brought us movies such as '12 Angry Men', is the heist movie that dwarfs them all, especially because what happens on screen has actually happened, even though the names have been changed (Sonny's name was John Wojtowicz, and Leon's was Edward Aron, then Liz Eden).Al Pacino gives an outstanding performance, Chris Sarandon is very effective in his Academy Award Nominated part, and you also get a strong supporting cast in Cazale, Charles Durning (Liutenant Moretti), James Broderick (the FBI Agent in charge) and Lance Henricksen (Agent Murphy).As for the rest, the idea of not having any soundtrack except for 'Amoreena', which is the song you hear in the opening is dead on, the direction is great and everything flows in the best way.Dog Day Afternoon: 10/10.",Dog Day Afternoon 1975.csv

snorlax3111984,8,2,6,04-Apr-17," Pros And Cons Of The Unabridged Version of Once Upon A Time In America
","Pros: 1. This is one of those movies that you need to see more than once. The first viewing may confuse you with the shifts in time but the more you see it and the more closely you pay attention , you see the movie is well-constructed and it doesn't jump through time just to be artsy.2. Bad child actors are at least twice as annoying as bad adult actors, so it's a relief that all the child actors are good, even if the boys didn't grow up to be Oscar-Winners like Jennifer Connelly. They can be believable as criminals while maintaining a certain level of innocence. On tough streets like that you had to do what you needed to survive.3. De Niro And Pesci prove they don't need Scorsese to make a good movie, having Scorsese just really really helps (let's not forget that James Woods would work with De Niro, Pesci and Scorsese in ""Casino""). It's a shame Pesci wasn't in the movie as much as Sergio Leone originally intended but the work Pesci does in this movie is great.4. Very glad Burt Young found time in between Rocky III and Rocky IV to be in this movie. His story about insurance is hilarious and definitely sounds like something Paulie would say in an R-Rated Rocky movie. Like Pesci, it's shame Burt Young is in the movie so briefly but at least Burt Young has a definite end and doesn't just disappear from the movie like Pesci.5. The music is phenomenal. Certain musical themes are consistently reused and they never get old. The instrumental version of Yesterday is sadly appropriate for a movie in which the good times were clearly in the past. It helps that the scenes with Elderly noodles are in 1968 when the Beatles were still active though well on their way to breaking up. 6. Like The Corleone Family in The Godfather, I always get a kick out of seeing the main characters get the better of their opponents, whether it's a corrupt cop, a hoodlum who would kill a child or a strike-busting cop. I especially love how they use the strike-busting cop's newborn son to get the cop under their thumbs in a way without putting the baby in danger.7. For the most part, this film does a great job of avoiding any accusations of being a Godfather rip-off. There's just a few moments that vaguely remind of The Godfather. For instance, the kids blackmailing a cop (who was often very hard on them) for having sex with a minor reminds me of the condescending senator in Godfather Part II who ended up under the Corleone's thumb after finding himself in bed with a dead prostitute.8. I liked the scene where the kid chooses a Charlotte Russe with whipped cream over sex with Peggy. A woman's much sweeter than wine but not as sweet as good candy.9. Despite nearly running 4 hours, this film is never boring and scenes never feel unnecessary. 10. Best Line: Dominick: Noodles, I slippedCons: 1. Rape is never a pro. The worst thing is that Noodles never really gets a comeuppance or apologizes for his actions. Though perhaps he went to the train station the next day attempting to apologize to Deborah. Carol seems delighted to meet her attackers again. While Deborah isn't happy to meet Noodles again, she doesn't tell him to get out of her sight or even mention the rape (perhaps she just put it behind her after 30 years).2. I would have liked to see more of the Eve character. We don't even see her meeting Noodles, she's just there in Florida all of a sudden. It's never really indicated whether Noodles really cared about her of if she was just a substitute for Deborah. Would Noodles cheat on Eve with Deborah if he could? It seems Eve's only true purpose in the movie is to be killed so we can see how badly the bad guys want Noodles. Even if the story had been told chronologically and she didn't die in her first scene, I doubt her death would have much impact.3. The relationship between Noodles and Deborah as kids is a tad confusing. She's usually very rude to him (not that you could blame her for being rude to a peeping tom) then this one moment she's tender before she does back to being rude. 4. Elderly Noodles tells Max he's crazy and Max responds ""You said that to me once before"". Noodles actually said it twice before: at the Florida beach and in New York shortly after Noodles makes the phone call that (he thinks) betrays Max.5. In the poster for Deborah's Cleopatra play, it mentions that age could not wither her beauty. How could age affect Cleopatra? She committed suicide at age 39. Cleopatra didn't give age a chance to affect her beauty",Once Upon a Time in America 1984.csv

It's not even all the numerous anachronisms and historical blunders that makes this picture The Worst. No, that would just make it plain bad, but what really earns this film 1 out of 10 (would have given it negative vote if i could) is that it really is a propaganda movie nearly as bad as bad as anything Leni Riefenstahl has ever made! Maybe even worse because in Pearl Harbor it's more subtle and disguised as an epic war movie.The propaganda in Pearl Harbor works, in short, like this: First we are shown how the horrible attack on Pearl Harbor was launched and are treated to all the pain and suffering caused by the evil Japanese. Which is supposed to fill us with righteous wrath against the Japanese. Then comes vengeance; America must revenge this most horrible deed, and decides to do so by launching a small air raid on some Japanese factories and strategic points, in which we are shown the bravery of the young soldiers and their glorious victory against all odds.Victory! Accompanied by epic music it's declared that from that moment on ""America has known nothing but victory"" and claims that this is what ended the war. Oh how glorious and brave! And with so few civil casualties, what a victory! ...or no wait, something feels wrong! No mention whatsoever about what really ended the war: the nuclear bombs dropped over the two major Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki!

","""Pawn Sacrifice"" (2015 release; 115 min.) is a fictional bio-pick about chess legend Bobby Fischer. As the movie opens, we get archive TV news footage from a bunch of different countries with the shocking news that Bobby Fischer did not show up for Game 2 of the Chess World Championship, as we see Fischer holed up in his room, refusing to come out. We then go back to ""15 November '51, Brooklyn, NY"", where we meet 8 yr. old Bobby, growing up with his mom. We already see his mind getting restless quickly, but also starting to astonish with his chess moves. At this point we're maybe 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: when I herd earlier this year that a movie was being made about the life and times of Bobby Fischer, and that it was directed by none other than Edward Zwick (the director of ""Glory"" and ""Defiance"", among others), I was pretty excited about it. Alas, it was not to be. What I thought would be a bio-pick on Fischer's life, turns out to be a very selective look instead. The movie's focus is clearly, and almost to the exclusion of everything else, on the 1972 World Championship against Boris Spassky. Yes, we do get a few glimpses of the younger Fischer. Fischer's mental problems do not get examined in-depth but are dealt with hastily. ""Bob has problems"" comments Father Lombarty, to which someone responds ""So did Mozart"", and end of story. Most disappointing for me was that the film essentially stops with Fischer's win in 1972. The remaining 36 years of his life, which remain clouded in mystery for a good part, are dismissed in about 2 minutes at the end of the movie. The leading acting performances, with Tobey Maguire as Bobby Fischer and Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky, are quite good, but keep your eye out as well for up-and-coming Canadian actress Ã‰velyne Brochu in the role of Donna, Fischer's very first girlfriend (when he already was in his 20s). If you are interested in a more in-depth look at the life and times of Bobby Fischer, I'd readily recommend the excellent 2011 documentary ""Bobby Fischer Against The World"".""Pawn Sacrifice"" opened this weekend on five screens for all of Greater Cincinnati.

tbmforclasstsar,10,59,118,14-Feb-10," Shutter Island Lives Up to the Name
","From the first note of the score, to the last shot on the screen I was completely enthralled by Martin Scorsese's latest Picture. Shutter Island, the story of two federal marshals investigating a patient escape at a maximum security hospital for the criminally insane, is very simply put: an experience. Shutter Island works because it pulls at all different emotions. An audience is both humored, and on the edge of tears; jumping out of their seat, and sinking deep within it. For 2 hours and 18 minutes, one is completely submerged into a Gothic, noir like world that is intriguing and horrifying at the same time. Shutter Island is definitely under the genre of thriller, but it is much more than just this. Sir Kingsley said it beautifully the next day at a press conference I attended: ""Though it looks like a thriller, the glue that holds it together is varying levels of tenderness."" The characters are enthralling and real, whether it be the protagonist, Teddy (DiCaprio) or Dr. Cawley, the head psychiatrist of the asylum (Sir Kingsley). From the opening shot to the final scene, the audience is left guessing to the mysteries of this island and its patients, being thrown into a world that is extremely claustrophobic without being tightly spaced. This feeling, and the success of the island's atmosphere, can be credited in many ways to the film's iconic director, Martin Scorsese. Fresh off his first Oscar ever for Best Director in The Departed, Scorsese takes things to a different gear in Shutter Island. While The Departed was a modern day mob thriller, Shutter Island is set in the 1950's, post WWII and at the start of the Cold War and McCarthyism Era. Paranoia is at an all-time high, many people are on edge, and this story is not only set during this time period, but on a secluded, Gothic island with only one way to leave and at the start of a terrible hurricane. If that doesn't excite an audience, it should simply be Scorsese's style. The film is full of flashbacks and haunting dream sequences that range in location from the island itself to the concentration camp at Dachau. The audience is constantly trapped in a world where one questions what is reality and what is dream. This is already interesting on paper, as seen in the critic's praise of Dennis Lehane's novel which the film is adapted from, but Scorsese absolutely blows the audience out of the water with the visuals; frightening images of pain and anguish, terrifying fears and paranoia, and jarring cuts and sequences that leave the viewer as haunted as the characters themselves. Scorsese truly rolls up his sleeves and produces a powerfully intense film that shakes the viewer until the very end.Aside from the amazing direction, the acting performances in this film were quite moving as well. Dicaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Sir Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, and Emily Mortimer were brilliant in their roles and (with the help of a masterful director's skill) took Shutter Island to a terrifyingly beautiful place that keeps us wanting more and more. From every beautiful crane shot, to each close up, Shutter Island is the latest tour de force in an already astonishing resume for Martin Scorsese. No one ever escapes Shutter Island unscathed, but if you can handle its pure power, it truly is a fantastic cinematic experience.",Shutter Island 2010.csv

Lonnis_Cult,5,49,86,20-Jul-19," Lacking substance
","I saw Yesterday a few weeks ago, I wasn't surprised by what I saw. Very average and missed opportunities are really my general thoughts on it. The interesting places that the film could have gone were wasted and replaced by a boring romance and a sappy ending. Jack Malik could have been so much more interesting as a character if he actually made mistakes and did bad things. Since the very beginning of the film, he's a good person that knows stealing the Beatles music is bad. That's boring. The two other people that remembered the Beatles should have had much more conflict with Jack and not just thank him for ""sharing the Beatles to the world"" as soon as they met him. The film would be ten times better if Jack had gone ahead with becoming famous, resulting in him becoming rich and arrogant, and the two people who remembered the Beatles try and expose him. Jack's friends and love interest grow to dislike him, and Jack realises that he needs to change and come clean. Something like that.
Oh, good God, Ellie was the absolute worse. The romance between her and Jack was so generic and lame. If Ellie loved Jack so much, than why didn't SHE ask him to a date? Why was she waiting for Jack to ask? She was annoying and entitled.
And speaking of romance, what the hell was up with Rocky ending up with the other woman we saw at Ellie's house? I saw them together in montage at the very end of the film, but they're never seen talking to each other during the film. You can't just add some romance between too characters who don't even interact through the film.
The humour was pretty weak, too. But if I'm being honest, I'm probably too young to find the humour funny since the adults around me were laughing, and I'm definitely not the target demographic. However, why the hell was Jack's friends laughing at him when he was hit by a bus?? Do they know that he could have been severely injured or killed? Imagine seeing the person you love in a hospital bed, all bloodied up and you just laugh? That's horrible.
The only reason I didn't give the film a 0/10 is because it isn't unwatchable. There are some cool and pretty shots, decent acting and the very rare moment where I smiled. Other than that, the film lacks substance and interesting characters. I guess it works as a love letter to the Beatles, but definitely a wasted opportunity for an interesting concept.",Yesterday 2019.csv
FlorisV,7,0,2,13-Jul-08," Stephen King all the way, not too original though
","I really like Stephen King films, even if they're just in his storyteller's style without the story actually been his (movies like Creepy Crawlers). Townsfolk, real communities, people you can care about are usually given some room for characterizations before bad things start to happen and this one is no different.This is not the most original horror movie ever (Dawn of the Dead and The Fog come to mind among a slew of monster movies) and it's certainly not the best as some claim. The only monster we have never seen before is in the ending and it doesn't get much action. Yup, it's about monsters. And the real monsters are the humans when they're desperate and scared.It's a good, enjoyable film though with good acting. Never a dull moment and you really keep wondering...what's next. The hysteric ranting about the apocalypse does fit in well because at first it seems like they're struck with one biblical plague after another.An OK film that's worth a view if you like Stephen King films. Some mentioned Ctulhu and the story definitely seems inspired by H.P. Lovecraft at some point (won't spoil it). I would definitely love to see film adaptations of that writer.

","If you could take one tablet to make you smarter, faster, more entertaining, probably richer and maybe even sexier, would you take it?Apparently we only use 20% of our brain function, some less than others of course but imagine if you could suddenly use all of it. Everything you ever learned, read or seen, instantly at your disposal with the communication skills and confidence to match.Struggling New York writer Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is faced with this dilemma, not for long, as the pill is on the way down before you can say, was that FDA approved? Suddenly Morra can finish his book, start trading derivatives and complex financial instruments, whilst learning several languages and getting a hair cut.In a nicely played moving montage, it is clear he has made it or is certainly well on his way.Of course this is a movie, so the path to true success and happiness cannot run true and many scenarios are thrown in his way before the well played and slightly ambiguous denouement.If you can get through the opening nausea inducing credits, this a fun film which does not take itself too seriously. Plenty of thrills and spills and whilst dabbling in the ethical dilemma the screenplay poses, it stays firmly in the shallow end, leaving deeper waters to other films.Of course with so many illegal substances freely available in many parts of the world, the opening question is somewhat moot, the answer increasingly being, hell yeah. Of course whilst the real life upside is likely to be lessened, the downside is about the same, albeit without hit-men attempting to assassinate you in most cases.Cooper, a late replacement for an injured Shia Le Beouf, does well in his first starring role. Perhaps not a true breakout role but another solid entry into his filmography and increasing star status.The film does veer off track when the inevitable downside and side effects present themselves, few moviegoers like watching ""Junkie"" acting but the story picks up a good head of steam for a rousing send off.It is good to see De Niro back on the screen although solid, he adds little star power here. Lindy (Abbie Cornish) adds more to the proceedings as Morra's long suffering girlfriend.The violence is occasionally more than you are expecting but the transformation of a Eastern block drug dealer (Howard) is rather amusing to watch.""More finesse, I like that word, I did not know it before"" Summary Good fun with a neat concept that it is not fully utilized but provides a solid couple of hours of entertainmentEnjoyable, entertaining and confirms that Cooper might yet become a true star, even before the inevitable ""Hangover 2"" arrives.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",Limitless 2011.csv

axsun19,9,2,4,10-Nov-12," Barnabus Collins scorns a witch who loves him and she turns him into a vampire and destroys his family's fortune. He returns 200 years later to revitalize it all.
","I really do not understand why this movie is getting such a bad reputation.My theory is that people were expecting something that this film was not: they wanted it to be true film adaptation to the original soap opera source material, they wanted to see Nightmare Before Christmas 2, they wanted a dark horror movie, they wanted a hilarious fantasy comedy, or maybe they expected Batman Returns Again.If you watch this film with ANY expectations like the above, then you will be sorely disappointed. That is not to say that this film is bad because I actually love this film and think it's very, very good.Tim Burton is really at the top of his directing game here because this movie is actually a blend of silly comedy, dark fantasy, 70's period piece, and revenge. These are drastically different genres but Burton sews them together very smoothly. One scene will have Barnabus trying to ""fit in"" to the 70's with silly results, and the next will be a blood- sucking murder of one of the characters. This movie has ghosts, vampires, werewolves, witches, and somehow they all cohesively fit together without trying to kill each other for attention for the audience.You can also tell that the script has been polished and fine-tuned to a brilliant level. I never once got tired of action or tired of the drama because Burton and his writers spaced things out and paced the movie very well. You never feel rushed to the end of the movie or dragged slowly through the mud; this film changes the pace accordingly to the ultimate climax at the end.Of course none of this would work out if you didn't believe in the film's main character Barnabus Collins. Johnny Depp anchors this film with his truly amazing acting. If you reread his lines in this movie, you will know that a lesser actor will have audiences laughing at the ridiculousness of his words. I always thought Depp was good in general, but I am not a huge obsessive Depp fan. But he deserves high praise here because you can tell he takes his craft very seriously and it pays off. Depp plays Barnabus very straight-faced with no theatrical ""wink"" to the audience; he reads his lines as if he really were an 18th century merchant who turned into a vampire and has resurrected in 1972. Equally important in this acting category is Eva Green, who plays Barnabus' former lover and the witch who turned him. Her character is more ""out there"" in terms of villains and she needed to act with the appropriate grandiose bad guy and obsessive-ex-girlfriend levels at the same time. She is fantastic here because she shows vulnerability as an ex who wants Barnabus back but also a cut-throat businesswoman out to destroy him. Oh yeah, I forgot she also has to play a villainous witch on top of those two qualities. She shines and plays a great counterpart to Depp.In this movie, I found myself laughing, curious, and creeped out at the various times. I also came into this movie expecting nothing more than to be entertained, and it delivered more than that. I know Burton has a history of doing certain types of movies, but please don't go in expecting this and that. You have very polished and solid writing, very good acting, and silly comedic reliefs throughout the film.

","I'm surprised at some of the negative comments. I've frequently got the impression that people judge books, films, ... by what they expect rather than by what is presented to them. So the more you don't meet their expectations the more they dislike it. Why should we want to know what happens to the fat guy? He disappears. That's normal in life. It's perfectly clear to me why the daughter doesn't want to see him.

And I'm glad I did see it now.I think many of the complaints others made are due to the fact that this is based on a true story and it does come across as fairly ""true"" in some ways. In real life diaglogues are frequently flat and in real life characters are frequently one-dimensional. Also the structure is partly influenced by the fact that you have to cram a life time into roughly 2 hours. I think they do a fairly good job here.The film is quite funny at the beginning but - predictably - George Jung's life turns sour.

","What can I say? The whole theater laughed during this whole movie. There were a few cheap laughs and some very obvious jokes thrown in, but the delivery was par for the course as far as Farrell is concerned. In other words, if Farrell is your kind of comedic character, you'll love this movie. If, say, Hugh Grant is your idea of a comic character, you'll probably hate this movie. Will Farrell's character was essentially Ron Burgundy on ice skates, which is a great idea. Ron Burgundy was, of course, the embodiment of the so-called ""alpha-masculine"" persona of the '70s and '80s. - unabashedly proud, sexist, and narcissistic. Put him into a sport that in many peoples' eyes in inherently effeminate and you've got a sure-fire crowd pleaser.Jon Heder was a little less Napolean Dynamite-ish in this movie. He is still the same innocent, ignorant, nerdy, awkward person as in his debut character. That said, he is a little more image-aware in this character, and as the movie progressed I saw less Napolean Dynamite (a major problem in his career until now, IMO), and I saw more of this ""other"" character. Heder's character is hard to describe other than to say it is Napolean Dynamite combined with Derek Zoolander - a lovable ignorant narcissist. Put that on ice skates opposite Ron Burgundy the figure skater and you have 93 minutes of great fun.What really makes this film work is Farrell's willingness to do anything in a movie and Heder's reluctance to do such things. They are polar opposites as far as comedic actors and their comedic emphasis are concerned.

The style of Oliver Stone is recognizable in the visions and flashbacks, something that might put down Troy fans, but that certainly adds character to the movie.

Those of you reading this have probably seen X-men, and those of you who haven't know the details(plot, characters, etc.) from reading other reviews, so I'm going to skip that part.

The story is far-fetched, but fine. I have no problem with imagination as long as it is done right, and X-Men does a good job explaining mutants, etc., even though it is a pretty ridiculous plot. It explains it enough to where you can forget about the problems with it, accept that there are mutants, and enjoy what they are doing on screen. Aside from 1 or 2, the characters are fine, the story is acceptable and to tell you the truth, they set it up well at the end for the imminent sequels. But, the script is too cliche' and actually takes away from what could have been a very good film.

I am well off compared to people like Mr. Ayers; as this movie exposes - most homeless do not.Somewhere our country lost a Great Truth - not everyone can be a viable citizen - every waking moment of awareness. As a Nation, we let go of the insane asylum concept in the 70's and left nothing in its vacuum. The churches scrambled to fill it - yet most lost funding. In the 90's, halfway houses were developed and most California counties survive on this answer. It is a good answer, yet as we can see, not every individual can embrace being inside.Somewhere in our Nation's future, we need to build viable, renewable gardens for the homeless. A Skid row with food growing on the walls. Why? Because the answer for most of today's mental illness is found in the healing power of food and today, we have viable methods for growing food vertically. America needs self-sustaining answers for the long-term.Fore the very Soul of a Homeless man is as Beautiful as any healthy citizen on the grid - they have simply lost the ability to articulate it and communicate it - and their citizenship is just as important as our own.

drakula2005,10,53,97,19-Jan-13," An Unforgettable Experience Brought By Muschietti, Del Toro and Chastain ! !
","First of all, my fellow moviegoers and horror-fans, i must begin by saying, that, even in a decade's time, i doubt that my instant love for this film would have changed in any way.Was it because of the wonderful work of the entire cast and crew on the film that struck me?Or even that rare feeling you get, when a film has been carefully nurtured with love and selflessness and raised up to be one of the best in the genre to come out for a good long while?Or is it the wonderful Jessica Chastain with a little mix of Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau's assuring performance as Lucas, and of course, Isabelle NÃ©lisse's and Megan Charpentier haunting performances of Lilly and Victoria.And once we are rolling and underway, Muschietti and Del Toro never really let us go.Their ideas, their intelligence and vision, along with some brilliant acting, made this film a special cinematic experience.Suspense and horror wise the filmmakers have made a wise choice not to go with blood, gore and other clichÃ©s nowadays horrors are filled to the brim with.Another great choice is the masterful cast they have chosen-Chastain, Waldau the whole cast.And since i'm very fond of Chastain, i will get on the subject thoroughly in a moment.The film was shot in incredible style not revealing in the opening scenes and ,step by step, showing more and more, both story and emotional wise.Not only that, but with the titular character of Mama, we find more about her, we see more of her, and in the end, we experience what means being her, being all of them.This storytelling arc i found very suspenseful and the great character development in Annabel and Victoria, the bigger sister, lead up to the climax, which is very heavy on emotions, pain and a triumph of the director's extraordinary vision.Which, in my humble opinion, leads to the strongest quality, that this film has in it's possession:the cast!!Game of Thrones's Waldau does a really solid job portraying Lucas, the uncle, who never gave up on his nieces and kept searching, when nobody else did, he never let go.Isabelle NÃ©lisse and Megan Charpentier are great playing the two wild, insecure, girls and manage to find the perfect line between this world and the civilization they are so reluctantly brought into by their uncle and his girlfriend.Although the word ""girlfriend"" is very misleading in this situation, it does no justice to the relationship between Chastain's Annabel and Waldau's Lucas at all.Throughout the whole movie we have seen real love and real human feeling, not just a bunch of teens sleeping together and fooling around which basically happens in every horror movie.But here, people are full-blooded, real, emotional, humane.So, they clearly love each other, after all Annabel stayed with him in order to help him raise his nieces, they moved in a new house together, she left her life of the tattooed, beer-drinking, guitar-playing, Rooney Mara-resembling woman, that was not yet ready to be a mother.At the end, Annabel has become so fond of the girls, that she takes the role of a real mother, caring, protecting and loving them, when Lucas in not around.She is risking her own life for them and is gifted with the love of the bigger sister, Victoria, in return, which ultimately proves to be at the center of the main conflict-the unconditional love of two mothers towards the two sisters, and the choice that they have to make.A real mother, or Mama-a hurt, but jealous ghost, with a history of her own, a mother, who is able to take a life in order to preserve it, a mother, who defended the two children for years in the wild, as if they were her own, but not a real, full-blooded mother at all...There is no right choice here, which means things are ultimately going to end bad in one way or another...So, for those who were able to bear with me for so long, i'm going to wrap it all in a nutshell:this film is an experience, that needs to be seen, an experience, resembling a beautiful, but also painful story with no winners and real, human emotions.It reminds me of Nicole Kidman's The Others in a way...And being introduced to Jessica Chastain's warm and full-blooded portrayal of an otherwise clichÃ©d character, that she shows has been played the wrong way all those years, is the most important experience for me.She was brilliant, and as i have grown to love Chastain for her roles in the past two years, for her devotion and skillfulness, she is the best choice for this role.If horror movies had more overall quality and were higher-regarded as movies not only made for the purpose of cheap jumps, but for enjoying a piece of film making of real cinematic value, in a world where scripts are better, Jessica Chastain could even get nominated for an Oscar among other high-profile awards for her mesmerizing and beautiful, yet humane portrayal of a forced-by-the-circumstances mother, ready to do anything to protect the ones she loves.So, with the 1000-word limit upon me, for one of the best films in the genre for the last years and a wonderful film as a whole, this piece of devoted filmmaking and acting, will keep you mesmerized until the very end and you'll be discussing it even afterward.It definitely left an impression on me, and i can't wait to see the beautiful Chastain again, as soon as possible, as she has proved to be equally impressive and devoted in every genre she has worked in and every role she has taken.The one-two, that's shaping up at the U.S. box-office this weekend for her, proves she covers more cinematic ground than most, and that the future is bright in her presence!I wish her the Lead Actress Oscar this year, as she absolutely deserves it for her work on Zero Dark Thirty!My rate:a deserved 10/10 !!!",Mama 2013.csv

Rodrigo_Amaro,10,1,4,16-Apr-10," Peckinpah Goes to War
","In ""Cross of Iron"" director Sam Peckinpah tells an story about true heroes and their real acts of heroism and false heroes and what do they do to be recognized as brave mens and guarantee all the fame to the themselves. During the Second World War the Prussian Captain Hauptmann Stransky (Maximilian Schell) fights along the Nazists even though he dislikes Hitler. All he wants is to put his hands in a medal of honor named ""Cross of Iron"", a medal given to acts of bravery in a battle. He's a total coward, manipulates his subordinates and does everything he can to win this medal. But he's the new leader of the squad. Newly promoted Sergeant Rolf Steiner (James Coburn) is the good guy in this story, the good German. He's gonna be one of the many obstacles that Stransky got to deal with. Steiner is a real hero, a guy who always risks his life in order to protect his friends and even potential enemies like a Russian soldier boy that he kept as prisoner. But both men are united against the Soviets in a desperate attempt to survive.Along with the vanities, friendship, bravery, pride and the Cross of Iron there's also the battles, the shootings, blood, insanity, fights like a typical war movie. The originality of this movie is to show the German side of the war, a side that's almost isn't showed in movies and here they got the chance to be the ""heores"" of the story even that we know that in real life wasn't that way. If you're looking to an accurate story don't watch it. But if you want with bloody battles and a good story you must watch it. This is the only incursion of Sam Peckinpah into war films and he really did a terrific job here. It might not be violent as ""The Wild Bunch"" but it has many characteristics of his preview works (the great editing alternating slow motion and still images and then moves forward). Another rare and interesting aspect is the homosexual relationship between the Leutnant Triebig (Roger Fritz) and a young soldier named Kepler (the actor is not credited). Their relationship appears briefly in a scene when both are caught by Stransky (they don't know that). Stransky uses their unfoldment as a way to use Triebig as an allied to his plans. I think that this worked really well in the movies, it's not something you see even in recent war movies. The focus here it's not only the war strategies but the man strategy to get what he wants, even if all he wants is a medal or to stand for those he likes.Good performances by James Coburn, Maximiian Schell (the best in scene), James Mason, David Warner and Igor Galo (he plays the young Leutnant Meyer). Since this was an very underrated movie by the time of its release I hope that someday (soon) maybe Hollywood remake this classic. Here comes an suggestion: Tom Wilkinson must play Captain Stransky, I can picture he playing this almost villain.",Cross of Iron 1977.csv

DICK STEEL,10,26,57,29-Jun-12," A Nutshell Review: The Amazing Spider-Man
","I would never have thought Garfield as the right person for the job. But I'm glad that he had proved me wrong, just as how Marc Webb had unequivocally stated that we haven't seen nothing yet with what Garfield can do with the role. He morphed into Peter Parker the shy lad, like hand in glove, and then transformed into the heroic Spider-Man sans mask, straddling and struggling with his dual identities just as how any scrawny teenager would if to be blessed (or cursed) with new found abilities, highlighting awkwardness and the building of confidence to perfection. Webb knew exactly what he was looking for in a leading man and allowed plenty of emotional engagement and attachment to Garfield's Peter, with Garfield proving him right, and now carries the superhero mantle with aplomb, nailing it as an unlikely hero.Then there's Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, equally important as the romantic fodder for Peter Parker, and this update had given us a leading lady character who has beauty and brains combined, together with a degree of spunk that Mary Jane Watson in the previous three films had lacked, with the latter falling prey in each and every installment that it was getting pretty tired. Stone has proved to carry an entire film on her own, and here shares incredible chemistry opposite Garfield to make them that cute couple in school who have to battle the pangs of first love, and not only having to deal with that strong emotion, but loss as well. While that Maguire-Dunst upside down tongue gymnastics is something hard to beat, Garfield-Stone do have their little romantic stunt that adds a degree of fun that each of Raimi's version lacked. Which is a good thing especially when trying to sway over the nay- sayers.I suppose almost everyone out there will know what to expect already from an origin movie, and James Vanderbilt's story kicks off into high gear from the get go, weaving and setting a new stage and universe in which this version of Spider-Man will thrive under, with Oscorp being that scientific conglomerate headed by an unseen, but constantly mentioned Norman Osborn, and having the mythos deeply involving the corporation, opening doors to possibilities that any subsequent film can cover, especially with that end credits scene. It also picked up from the Batman Begins template in a number of areas, but I'm not complaining because it's all good to successfully reboot the franchise, adapting elements from its comic book source which serve as canon, but giving it a different angle that maintains the spirit of things and events, even key ones like Uncle Ben's demise that truly shaped the destiny of the wall-crawler.As always with the Spider-Man mythos, Peter Parker deals more with loss, and loses more than he's won, and having that retained in the film made it venture down a darker road, and being more vulnerable. And going back to basics never hurt, with one single villain in Dr Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) as the Lizard, even if an army of Lizards were hinted at from merchandise, and keeping/hinting at others who may appear in subsequent movies. The villain-hero set up was reminiscent of the second Raimi film with Peter Parker and Dr Octopus sharing a connection before the latter went bonkers, and provided yet again another battle on the emotional front. The Lizard may be lesser known, but is a powerful foe that audiences may have already been primed for from Raimi's films if they were to do a little research on the recurring Connors character then.Action wise, Webb had gotten excellent material from the comics and clearly dipped into them for inspiration, with Spidey's iconic poses and movement all making it into the film, coming off as poetry in motion. This was something that the earlier Spider-Man films had paled in comparison, with action sequences all being more kinetic in treatment, utilizing a whole slew of Spider-abilities. And the mechanical web shooters weren't all that bad, since again it went back to basics to showcase Parker's intellect, if only for a short while during a montage as does showing off his sewing skills. Webbing plays a big role in being the arsenal of choice, and the variation shown in this film is staggering, with the previous films never even coming close to how this Spider-Man excelled in fighting with them. And with those webshooters, you'll be itching for moments when the web fluid would run out, or to have something happen to them like how the Stan Lee (probably the best cameo appearances of all Marvel films here) devised in his stories, just to provide additional challenge.Marc Webb had shown not only Sam Raimi can make a good Spider-Man summer blockbuster, and I'm pretty sure Webb's version can stand up to and probably excel from the predecessors.",The Amazing Spider-Man 2012.csv
leehay-91684,10,7,12,23-Jun-17," Authentic. Compelling. Visceral.
","Vangelis once said ""Music has to be in the moment, not overthought, never to be repeated"" He also said "" To try to make a hit is failure; To make something honest is a success"".Both of these quotes fit Blade Runner perfectly. The making of Blade Runner was chaotic.The nature of the film changed several times before it even got made. Film staff and some cast dropped out. It nearly became a film noir with Dustin Hoffman as the lead. The two stars hated each other, and it was a box office flop when it first came out.The problem with films these days is that they are made by a board room of number cruncher's. A films success is based on box office takings, rather than anything of substance and virtuous accountability.Blade Runner has since made a profit. If it hadn't does that mean its a failure. NO.I can't help but think that part of the reason it was an initial flop was due to the interference of executives in the original release. The Directors cut and Final cut were what the film should of been 35 years ago.Phillip K Dick was a visionary. His books are not the easiest to turn into a film. I enjoyed Adjustment Bureau, yet just like Blade Runner originally, I hated the happy Hollywood ending. Im hoping for a darker directors cut where David and Elise future isn't to assured.I may be slightly biased as Blade Runner is one of my favourite films, but for the Directors Cut and the Final Cut everything just works perfectly together, like a Jigsaw.The tension between Harrison Ford and Sean Young is real, they hated each other. Vangelis was in his prime. The cinematography is stunning. Ridley Scott is one of the most influential directors going. I like that for the Final Cut, it was treated subtly. They didn't over do the CGI, Gloss and mastering.The scene where Deckard 'Retires' Zhora leaves you battling your conscience. A woman was basically murdered in cold blood. Shot in the back as she was running away. All in slow motion with the beautiful ""Blade Runner Blues"" summing the scene up, shining a light on the cold nature of the killing.When I saw the Directors cut, I was pleased that Ridley Scott was finally allowed to say a big Fu!! you to Hollywood. The daring nature that Deckard and Rachels fate is sealed. Living on borrowed time. As well as the ongoing questions. Is Deckard a Replicant ? Did Gaff let Rachel Live ? How long will they survive in the outside world ? Hollywood loves a happy ending. Ridely wasn't having that. As a director he is unapologetic. He hates the politics of Hollywood. He could finally discard the crap footage borrowed from the Shinning, in which we were expected to buy into the notion Rachel was different and built to survive, and they can live happily ever after.The unicorn scene in the directors cut, flips the film over and is the nail in the coffin to lets all dance into the sunset.The final sequence, when the elevator doors close on a forlorn Deckard and Rachel, and the thunderous baseline kicks in then all makes sense. What doesn't make sense is getting up the moment the film finishes and not staying to listen to Vangelis at his best.On a picky critical note: Some might say Deckard is supposed to be detective, but hardly does any investigating. Blade Runner isn't a detective murder mystery film. This is a film about humanity, empathy, equality, compassion, ethics. All challenges we face today.Is one life worth more than another ?",Blade Runner 1982.csv
devanshexe,10,0,1,05-Apr-20," The Intouchables: A Humorous Dive into a Sparkling Friendship.
","The Intouchables, originally a French Film, a winner of 38 ""Best Foreign Language Film award"", is the movie based on true events, is an intricately fabricated profound work of art, which surely is a medley of sparkling humor, subtle emotions, and a deep dive into nature of human relationships. It's truly an irresistible delight for the connoisseurs of the finest cinematic experience.The movie revolves around the two main characters - Philippe and Driss.Philippe, played by FranÃ§ois Cluzet, is a millionaire, and handsome aristocrat who is deep inside a free-spirited, fast-paced, adventure-loving, energetic and humor seeking person, meets an accident while Paragliding and happens to become a quadriplegic, a person who is paralyzed right from the base of his neck to the last toe on his foot. Philippe's life, now due to the helplessness given by quadriplegia, is limited to mostly the walls of his mansion, the routine care of doctors and caretakers and the pity of the rest of the world. In summary, he is living hell in the midst of his affluence.Due to the consistent exposure of pity, dependence, and helplessness, he happens to devote his life to intellectual activities, arts, music, drama, literary events, and epistolary relationships (distant conversations with a person through letters only). There is a lot of insipidity in his life, his true innate energetic and adventure-loving nature is now lost, which he has now accepted as his fate.He happens to meet and finally hires Driss, Omar Sy, as his caregiver, who is totally opposite of what Phillipe is from the outside. Driss is black west African, he is impulsive, he is uncultured, raw, reckless, violent, free-spirited, fast-paced, humorous and aimless person, who comes from one of Paris's poor, suburban high-rise ghettoes, and is seeking some money. He has also been recent to jail for 6 months for robbing a Jewelry store.In spite of two of them being so different, what binds them together is their total love for honesty, sense of humor and contempt for stuffy hypocrisy. And, most importantly Driss is actually the outward raw and honest manifestation of the true deep character of Phillipe. What Phillipe likes about Driss the most is, he treats him like a normal human being with all his arms and legs, he doesn't pity him, he doesn't make him realize of quadriplegia all the time and rather he makes him feel good, makes him feel lively and makes him laugh again, the laughter which was missing in Phillipe's life since ages. This becomes the greatest binding force in their relation.
Philipe shares that he lost his loving wife the same time he got quadriplegia and his true disability is not having to be in a wheelchair, but it's having to be without his wife.
Driss brings taste in Phillipe's insipid life. They both learn and grow with each other. Phillipe learns to enjoy the daily life mundane things apart from his literary and intense interests and at the same time, Driss gets more responsible and civilized in the journey!Both of them have performed phenomenally. Their every action and expression is praiseworthy. It's an epitome of a true and deep friendship that grips, holds and takes the spectator on an around 2 hours long journey of humor and subtle emotions.An inevitably must watch.",The Intouchables 2011.csv
NumeroOne,10,0,1,07-Mar-09," A campy, horrifying, and artful horror classic.
","At the IFC theater in NYC, there are weekly midnight screenings of Cronenberg movies. I've seen a few, but I haven't really loved any of them. A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is not afraid to navigate the extremes of cruelty and kitschy tenderness, but it didn't do a whole lot more than make me laugh and wince a bit. CRASH was very interesting but not fun, and really only memorable for its subject matter- not for any great scenes or performances. DEAD RINGERS really stuck with me, but the movie as a whole is a bit muddled and overlong. And EXISTENZ is ill-conceived Sci-Fi with lots of gore. I walked into last night's midnight screening with nothing more than curiosity, but I'm very glad I went. The film print was grainy but the richness of the colors in the original film more than made up for it. THE FLY is a gory, shocking, confusing movie that truly challenges and rewards the viewer. It challenges the viewer to laugh, cry, and cringe, for there are moments when nothing other than all three are possible. The movie opens with Brundle meeting journalist Veronica at a scientific convention. With only the minimal dialog necessary, the action begins, as we see Brundle's attempts to teleport objects and Veronica's fascination with the man. We barely get to know the characters before they are in bed together and one of them is doing wild and crazy things with technology, but what is amazing is that, while it all happens so quickly, nothing remains too mysterious. The dialog is all very focused and to the point and Jeff Goldblum as Brundle manages to make even lengthy exposition into entertaining ramblings.Brundle, even before he becomes a fly, is highly entertaining to watch, and this is key to the movie's success. And his transformation is done extremely well, as he first merely demonstrates a fly-like stamina and agility before he transforms into a confused human insect.It is not only Brundle's transformation that is disgusting- there is also a brief and surprising scene in which he demonstrates his new insect powers as he breaks an arm wrestler's hand off at a bar. This scene is disgusting and campy, yet it manages to achieve just the right level of shock and hilarity, and it fits with the movie's absurd tone.The special effects in the movie were done at a period which I believe to be the peak of movie special effects, when computer animation was just enabling us to see things that weren't possible, like a human body transforming into a fly, but it wasn't sophisticated or cheap enough for filmmakers to rely on it the entire time. When Brundle is still a human fly, it is done entirely with makeup, which makes it extremely convincing. Today, it would almost definitely be done with CGI, not because it would look better, but merely because it is cheaper and easier. The movie would not be nearly as convincing if it were done with today's effects technology.And the effects would also not be nearly as impressive if it weren't for the fact that the movie ultimately relies on other things to intrigue us. The effects are so, well, effective, because they really feed our interest. The movie really gets us to ask, ""What will happen to this man as he turns into a fly?"" and builds suspense hanging on that single question, and the effects show us all of the gory details- and the details turn out to be even more gory than we'd imagine.It was THE FLY that convinced me Cronenberg deserves his good reputation. It's truly one of the great monster movies.",The Fly 1986.csv

The characters in this 1913 story carry the plot. No golf swing is the same because the audience sees it from a different character's perspective which keeps the story moving. The director, Bill Paxton, knows what he is doing with the camera, story, and characters. The editing and pacing are so good that you don't even notice it towards the end. The clothing designs and dialogue are authentic. The movie is so much more than an ""inspirational sports movie"", though it is inspirational. Themes of social class and family ties convey a greater significance that leads to a rewarding payoff!

It combines elements from all kinds of genres, such as mystery, drama, history and thriller. And it all revolves around the complicated topic of religion. I would not say that I am generally a fan of religion-centered films, but if the quality is good, then I can watch it. And I also like lead actors Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, so it was really high time I would check this one out. But I was very much disappointed. The film tried to be so so much, so epic, so relevant and in the end nothing stayed, apart from the try-hard (that even rhymes).It was a very pompous film. They obviously put huge focus on costumes, sets, makeup etc. and in the end with the ultimately extremely uninspired writing, this is all that stays. It is a great example of style over substance. A major problem here is the runtime too. The story is rarely convincing and having to sit through this, almost 3 hours, at some point turns into a really painful watch. This film dragged a lot and I would have loved it to be 45 minutes shorter or even more. Not even Tom Hanks, who is always very likable, could elevate the material for me here. I guess, even for him, not every movie can be a winner. So yeah, I certainly do not recommend the watch and at this point I have zero interest of seeing any of the sequels to this one.

I like being surprised by the story a movie delivers, so sometimes  instead of reading ahead i just go to the cinema to be surprised. When  I found out what the plot was for this movie I felt like shooting  myself in the foot for not reading ahead.  Produced by Sony Pictures Animation, Hotel Transylvania has been in  development since 2006 with Miley Cyrus penned to play the voice of  Mavis (Dracula's daughter), but she later dropped the role and Selena  Gomez was given the role instead.  The movie's idea was to paint a scenario typical to that of  Pixar/Disney's Monsters Inc, where the monsters were afraid of the  humans, although in this twist the humans seems to love the Monsters.  Every movie runs on a typical fuel, Monsters Inc's fuel was they need  of screams for their energy, the fuel in this movie is Mavis (Selena  Gomez) desire to go to the outside world. This kind of driving force  for a movie is too flat based on the fact that the outside world is  just outside your door.  The voice casting/acting in this movie is not half as bad as the plot.  Adam Sandler voiced Dracula and did a fine job at it too. The movie's  plot is about Dracula, who lost his wife to an attack by humans.  Due to that, he built a hotel where the world's monsters can take a  rest from human civilization. In his list of invitees we have 1.  Frankenstein and his bride 2. Werewolf, his bride and their liter (and  may I tell you they have so much) 3. Mummy 4. Skeleton and bride 5.  Invisible man 6. And much more.  The movie does try to be funny, with lines like when Dracula told the  Invisible man, ""Hello! Great to see you""  The movie director Genndy Tartakovsky is behind the some notable  Cartoon Network animated television series, including Dexter's  Laboratory, Samurai Jack, Star Wars: Clone Wars, and Sym-Bionic Titan.  Genndy will also be directing an animated film based on Popeye.  Hotel Transylvania will have been best as a short movie that was like  30 mins long rather than a full length one that has nothing but wasted  scenes luring you to an expected end.

I know that this is the story of a guy whose life consists of such kind of activities, but the problem is that The Wolf of Wall Street is just a hilarious biopic, an entertaining popcorn flick, a dark comedy, an amusing adventure, but no more than that. This is a rise and fall story and during the whole movie, you don't feel bored. Comparing to Scorsese's old classics, this is just an ordinary movie. It doesn't feel like a Scorsese flick.

Brooks was considered a maverick by the NHL and, because he went his own way with a winning team, is believed to have contributed significantly to the 1980 win. The movie rightly includes the essentials of commentary from Al Michaels (the best hockey commentator bar none), as well as hockey trials, moments from exhibition games, and quite a number of scenes of Olympic games against the Czech and the truly amazing Russian teams. But, the movie actually omits the final pivotal Olympic game against Finland. We see nothing of the elimination of other teams. There is little on the essential player dynamics. One of the most poignant moments in sports, the sight of Jim Craig mouthing ""have you seen my dad?"" to a friend in the crowd, is completely overshadowed. Conversely, the film reveals only Jim Craig's familial situation - none of the other players have any family, girlfriends, or other conflicts to concern us.Kurt Russell did a great job of portraying Brooks. Putting on TV commercials and clips was an inspired way to put the movie in context. Adding what the players are doing today was a nice touch, and the clip of Brooks at the end was excellent.But the miracle was not just the coach, it was the time, the circumstances, the fans, and the hockey team, who played game after game after game at Lake Placid.

","Given all the impropitious factors that were stacked against this latest installment I think the film works reasonably well and has at least the visceral appeal that a 170 million dollar blockbuster should have. Yes it lacks the artistry and elan that Cameron brought to the first two installments and yes it does simply rehash and expand previous action sequences that made the first two films so enjoyable. However I found the acting to be serviceable and the human element was palpable enough to the point where it did not feel like a completely boneheaded action film. My main qualm with the characters was with the TX who was not fleshed out enough and not nearly as menacing as the T-1000 from the second film. The majority of the action sequences serve to simply entertain us and do so in spades. However they were also a way to mask the fact that the story was incredibly thin and the dialogue laconic and derivative of the popular catch phrases established in the first two films. But in conclusion it must be noted that outside of the context of the first two films this is a summer action movie that entertains and even makes fun of itself to the joy of the viewer. The action thankfully does not really too heavily on CGI effects and ends up boing much more entertaining than 'The Matrix Reloaded' or 'The Hulk' by action standards. Compared with the first two films it is no more than a road movie with action sequences and minimal sci-fi elements thrown in.

","""It was a scene straight out of hell. There is no other way to describe it."" This quote from Higa Tomiko, a survivor of the Battle of Okinawa when she was seven years old, may be the best description one can take away from ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the most recent World War II film directed by Mel Gibson in a stunning return to prominence among his Hollywood peers. It tells the story of Private Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who refused to handle a weapon, but felt it was his moral duty to serve his country in a time of war when many of his friends and neighbors opted to do the same. It's a story of perseverance, courage and sheer fortitude, and one bound to affect even the most hardened viewer.In terms of battle imagery, this is probably the most relentless, bloody and vicious film yet, even more so than ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"". The absolute carnage on display is not for the faint of heart, and there are more than one scene that come out of nowhere to jar the viewer upright in your seat. Director Gibson even utilizes the technique in a civilian scene when Desmond Doss and his brother wind up fighting each other as kids, and Desmond uses a brick to lay out his sibling in a frightening scene, one that establishes Doss's very first insights about the morality of taking a person's life.I thought Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Desmond Doss was superb during the battle segment which dominated the latter part of the picture. Some of the boot camp scenes came across as somewhat unrealistic to me in as much as Doss seemed to defy his superiors with a smile on his face and sometimes without recrimination, although he did suffer the abuse of his fellow soldiers who thought he was a coward. Another element that seemed to defy logic was how the entire company of men from training wound up in Okinawa together, including the officers from boot camp. Not having been in the military, I don't know how that works, but it didn't seem that likely to me.Generally, I have a problem with war films that introduce a romantic element, however Desmond's relationship with future wife Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) is handled with careful restraint. The interruption of Desmond's father (Hugo Weaving) at the military court martial proceedings was another one of those elements that seemed to defy credibility, so that's one I'll have to research.Because of the film's central focus on Desmond Doss and his heroic actions at Hacksaw Ridge, one might be tempted to believe that this was the only battle he participated in. In fact, Doss also served in the Pacific Theater in the battle campaigns of Guam and Leyte Gulf, earning an entire host of citations for his bravery, including the Medal of Honor. Totally unexpected, but a very welcome conclusion to the picture had clips of the real life Desmond Doss speaking to his experience during the war prior to his death in 2006. Stills of the young Doss bear a remarkable likeness to the actor who portrayed him, thereby adding a further sense of realism to the story in retrospect. Over all, the movie is a remarkable tribute to a man who held a deep conviction and commitment to a higher power while stating ""I figure I'll be savin' people, not killin'.""",Hacksaw Ridge 2016.csv

The film earned high praise early on but of course I had to see this for myself. I've let the viewing sink in and I know that I really like this film despite it being full of questions.The film follows a family after the death of the grandma. The family initially seems to be at odds with one another. We soon find out that the daughter of the family, Charlie, was close with her grandmother. Charlie is the type who is quiet and has odd mannerisms including a clucking sound. Without saying much more, the family experiences tragedy and find out that things aren't what they seem as they feel like they are being haunted by an evil presence.It is so hard to talk about the plot without revealing something crazy. Just watch this film. Its not a conventional horror film, the film is almost entirely devoid of jump scares and does not really and scaring you in the moment. The film is more cerebral; its a psychological film that is engorging from beginning to end. Its shot extremely well, and is detail oriented. Ari Aster absolutely knocks it out of the park in his film debut. There are things and moments in this film that I still question, and I feel like the director leaves many clues and easter eggs throughout. This film demands a second watch.I don't see Toni Colette in many films but my god she is amazing in this. Absolutely portrays every emotion perfectly. You see the rage, depression, fear, and absolute terror all emoted on her face. Such great praise for her and Alex Wolff who was also excellent.

","I just got back from seeing this and thought it was good - as in a solid 7 out of 10 good. There are a lot of perfect ratings, which I think has to do with people not expecting much going into it. The previews do a great job of not giving the drama away. To me a 9 or a 10 would be ALIEN, ALIENS or the first two TERMINATOR flicks.I like my eye candy, even if it's only a tracking shot of a desolate ROAD WARRIOR landscape. My main DISTRICT 9 criticism is the shaky cam, washed out, docu-style shooting. Considering the setting is a slum, this approach looks even worse. I would have preferred smooth photography and shadowy lighting. Now, that doesn't keep me from enjoying BLAIR WITCH or CLOVERFIELD, but I think of how much more I would enjoy these movies without that docu-style gimmick. Granted, this camera work is nowhere near as disorienting as those two, but I can't say that I want to eagerly revisit this world of shaky slum shots. The movie is like SLUM DOG ALIEN MILLIONAIRE! Some people are in awe of this being ""only"" a 30 million dollar movie. Did you expect Peter Jackson to ratchet up the WETA bill on his own production, or go with the low bid? There are no 20 million dollar actors in this. The aliens and effects are the stars of the movie, supported by a cast of unknowns. That's a good thing, because if the lead character was played by Tom Cruise, you would have certain anticipations. With the character of Wikus Van De Merwe, you don't know what to expect and that's the way it should be.What worked best about this movie was how the storytelling would paint the main character into a corner and arc him out of it. It's a classic polar transformation. What is equally impressive is the morphing of the aliens into something we ultimately care about.I like a lot of sci-fi and horror, so where does DISTRICT 9 sit for the year? I have to admit that I enjoyed STAR TREK a lot more. I would put this one in the mix with TERMINATOR: SALVATION and OUTLANDER. I really enjoyed those, more than probably most people. (I wouldn't ever expect McG to direct to the level of James Cameron, so no disappointment on my end.) Those movies are all easy on the eyes, whereas DISTRICT 9's superior characterization is counterbalanced by ugly backgrounds and photography. (I don't care how intentional that is, it made me enjoy it less than its potential.) TRANSFORMERS 2 was shallow fun, but sits near the bottom of my list. I still have to see WOLVERINE, but am not expecting much from it. EDEN LOG was just okay and if I had to pick on a movie, it would be DANTE 01, which was beautiful to look at, but bored me to tears. I haven't seen MUTANT CHRONICLES and some others.I'm anxiously awaiting PANDORUM, SURROGATES, DAYBREAKERS and the year end biggie,...James Cameron's AVATAR. Cameron's movies are what most modern sci-fi is compared to, so I'm anxious to see if he can live up to the hype after his long hiatus.

fidelio74,7,0,2,25-Dec-10," 'Dark City' shines
","Australian director Alex Proyas' 'Dark City' is a cerebral and splendid science fiction film noir. Many people have called it one of the best science fiction films ever made, and they are right. The film recalls 'Blade Runner', another sci-fi film noir. Proyas' vision is original and uncompromising, and he has crafted a wonderful head trip which really stays with you.John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakes in a bathtub with blood on his forehead. He is suffering from amnesia and believes himself to be a serial killer. He must discover his true identity and find an escape from the eternally dark city in which he lives.Murdoch's love interest in the film is Jennifer Connelly, and she is very well-cast in the role of John's wife, Emma/Anna. She was wonderful in another film noir, 'The Hot Spot', in which she starred with Don Johnson. In 'Dark City' she plays a sultry nightclub singer who is racked with guilt after cheating on her husband.The best thing about 'Dark City' is the presence of the tall and thin Richard O'Brien, who played Riff Raff in 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' way back in 1975. It is so great to see him again, and he lends a real gravitas to the proceedings. The Strangers, of which he is a member, are actually quite reminiscent of the Cenobites in the 'Hellraiser' franchise. These Strangers are an alien race who are trying to find out what makes us human. Every night at midnight, they induce the city's populace to fall asleep while they - the Strangers - change the city in order to alter our lives and to study how we respond.This is a clever and original film. Unlike some science fiction movies, it really stays with you. And it is further proof - if it was needed - that Australia is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to movie-making talent.",Dark City 1998.csv
Christian_Dimartino,10,17,37,03-Jan-13," The funniest film about racism, and that's a sentence that may never be typed again.
","For the past twenty years, writer/director Quentin Tarantino has been entertaining us in a hilariously cringing way. Sadly, those twenty years have only brought us only eight films (not counting his writing and producing efforts). But yet each one of those eight films has a marvelous quality. One of his qualaties is his killer dialogue, which is always whip smart and hilarious.Another quality is this: Tarantino has a gift for making the most serious of topics hilarious. This was displayed three years ago with his last film, Inglourious Basterds (my favorite film of 2009), which revolved around a group of Jewish Americans known as ""The Basterds"", who hunted down the Third Reich. With ""Basterds"", Tarantino re-wrote history in an extraordinary way, which probably led to a lot of bickering from historians. His latest film, Django Unchained, is even more controversial. Historians might bicker again. Forget'em. Sit back, shut up, and get consumed by QT's latest revenge fantasy.Django (Jamie Foxx, who I don't like but is enjoyable here) is a slave in the 1800's. Enter Dr. King Shultz (the expectedly brilliant Christoph Waltz, whose show-stealing performance in ""Basterds"" led him to a much deserved Oscar),a dentist/bounty hunter who lets Django free and gives him an offer he can't refuse: If he helps him hunt down some people, then he will help him find his wife, Bromhilda (the always lovely Kerry Washington). Bromhilda, as it turns out, is currently the slave of a damn lunatic plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio, giving one of his best performances).Waltz is always perfect, but really when DiCaprio is on screen it is his show. Like Waltz's Hans Landa from ""Basterds"", Tarantino has written yet another scene stealing villain. Candie is a maniac, and once DiCaprio steps on screen, he, as he says in the film,""had my curiosity, but now you have my attention"". Lastly, in his best performance in years, we have Samuel L. Jackson as Candie's conniving slave, Stephen. Almost unrecognizable in latex, Jackson's character is what the true definition of a bastard is. Great supporting work from the three. I expect to see at least one of them on the ballot this season.I have absolutely no idea where Django Unchained compares with every other QT film, because it feels like every QT film is better than the last. I can tell you that it's no Pulp Fiction, but that said, not many movies are as good as that one. What I can tell you is that this is one of the year's best, without a doubt in my mind. This is the funniest movie about racism, and that is probably a sentence that will never be typed ever again.But while being hilarious, it is also cringingly real, and it doesn't shy away from the fact that this period happened. The fact that a man could combine drama, action, and comedy together is really something to admire. Forget what Spike Lee has said. He's a hack compared to Tarantino. I loved every second of this film. I will admit that is does sort of run on a little too long, but really it's just a bloody good time from the opening credits and onward.

Asa_Nisi_Masa2,10,437,481,26-May-05," My Ten Commandments of Dog Day Afternoon! ;-)
","I've watched this film for the third time in a few years last night. Instead of writing a straight review, I'd like to jot down ten thoughts just off the top of my head concerning this exquisite movie: 1) Watching this film will change forever your perception of the bank heist genre, making you question the contrived cinematic conventions these films usually make use of.2) The source of this film's paradoxical and/or farcical elements spring from life itself, not from film or pre-existing cinematic conventions. Sometimes, the absurdities of life are so great, they dwarf those included in any form of fiction. Without even trying to make that point, this film captures that concept beautifully. 3) Its tone in relation to the homosexual theme is ahead of its time. In fact it's ahead of OUR time, even, in hardly making an issue out of it at all - it just IS. 4) It captures the climate of the 70s in a manner so sober, you'll remember its unshowy yet authentic feel forever.5) Lumet's film brings to life the concept of the distorting lens of the media and how different groups with different agendas will turn an outlaw into a hero, with far more efficiency than Oliver Stone's brash, bloated, childish and repetitive Natural Born Killers.6) Watching this film will illustrate to the younger generations exactly why Al Pacino has earned himself the legendary status he probably no longer would deserve with his performances of the last 10 years alone. **SPOILERS**: Just watch those last ten minutes of him handcuffed against the bonnet of a car, where he doesn't say a word, but speaks volumes with his eyes and his soul just oozing out of every frame at the end of the movie; you'll remember those eyes for as long as you live! 7) Watching this film, you'll realise that firing a gun-shot is a BIG DEAL in real life, and that other films make too much use of gun fire in a highly contrived way. 8) All that tension deriving from pointed guns unable to fire a shot OR move awayÂ… you realise Tarantino must've taken notes sometime along the way. 9) No genre is old or done too many times before if it's handled with this amount of freshness, inspiration and talent. 10) Watching Dog Day Afternoon for the third time has filled me with the same amount of wonder at the power of truly inspired but unobtrusive film-making as it did first time round.",Dog Day Afternoon 1975.csv

","A man awakens from a coma, only to discover that someone has taken on his identity and that no one, (not even his wife), believes him. With the help of a young woman, he sets out to prove who he is.Liam Neeson. Aka, the man. Despite his older age, he can still kick butt in movies, especially giving us a great performance. We've seen him show his vengeance in Taken, while showing a different side in the Grey, so I thought he would give us another great performance in Unknown... The movie's premise HAS been used before, yes, fact. It sounds a little like Bourne, but something about it makes you know there's going to be a twist to set it all together. The movie's acting was good. Liam Neeson, although a great actor, doesn't seem to use body language much. He tends to talk but never shows much emotion while he does it. That is, in fact, the only complaint I can give the movie, except for the clichÃ© plot. Everybody else did a pretty good job, and no one should be labeled a bad actor in this. I liked the director's filming style. He uses lush cinematography and good sound editing to bring it all together. Obviously the film wouldn't mean anything if there wasn't a twist. The thing about the twist is, I've heard it before. I didn't expect it BUT other movies have used this same technique on how to wrap the film up. The twist was good though, so I'm not exactly complaining. If I were to give the movie another complaint it would've been the CGI. They seemed a bit too highly editing to make it realistic BUT I give kudos to the director for at least trying. All in all, I would recommend this film. It's entertaining, fast-paced, and keeps you guessing until the end. The performances from every actor gives into the experience, and there is some badass action sequences. Although the premise has been used before, and even the twist, it's a great addition to the genre. 8/10.",Unknown 2011.csv
bankofmarquis,6,0,4,24-Jan-18," A missed opportunity
","12 STRONG had an interesting premise going for it - the true life, just released, top secret mission of the first Special Forces unit to be deployed in Afghanistan following the 9/11 terrorist attack. All set to conduct ""traditional"" warfare, these soldiers must learn to adapt to a different sort of war being waged in the caves and cliffs surrounding them - including fighting tanks while on horseback! And...with charismatic screen performers like Chris Hemsworth, Michael Pena, Trevante Rhodes, and (especially) Michael Shannon, the ingredients were there for a strong film.Unfortunately, Director Nicolai Fuglsig (in what is, in essence, his big screen debut as a Director) and Writers Ted Tally and Peter Craig squander this opportunity and present a fairly bland, fairly generic action/adventure flick reminiscent of the Chuck Norris Vietnam flicks of the 1980's (like MISSING IN ACTION or THE DELTA FORCE).Not only that, but with a film entitled 12 STRONG, you would expect the 12 soldiers to be an interesting group of characters (a la THE DIRTY DOZEN or ALIENS), unfortunately, this should have been called Chris Hemsworth plus 3 and a bunch of glorified extras. The lion's share of this film follows Hemsworth's rookie Captain develop into a ""warrior"". This is an interesting character played by a charismatic actor and would have been more interesting had we not spent a vast majority of the film with him. After awhile I wanted to yell at the screen - ""All right! I get it! He has to learn how to kill without losing his humanity"". Also featured in this group are Michael Pena as the ""Gung-Ho GI"" of the group (with a smart mouth, of course) and Trevante Rhodes (following his breakout performance in MOONLIGHT) who befriends a young, local boy (you can guess how that goes). Both of these character arcs play out rather predictably. But the biggest sin in this film is the misuse of the great Michael Shannon as the 2nd in command. Perhaps Shannon's schedule did not allow more use of him, but he was barely in this film and what time he was used it was well below his abilities of an actor - a major disappointment.To this film some slack, the action is serviceable which makes it worth watching - an element that elevates this mediocre film to something just north of that.If you're looking for an escape from the January cold, you could do worse, an enjoyable - enough - 2 hours in the theater.Letter Grade: B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",12 Strong 2018.csv

","The 1988 action thriller DIE HARD was such a huge critical, commercial, and artistic success that it was probably inevitable, given Hollywood's mentality that there is never too much of a good thing, that a sequel would follow.  The result, thus, is DIE HARD 2.Bruce Willis returns as John McClane, who on this Christmas Eve is at Dulles International Airport in Washington awaiting the arrival of his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) from Los Angeles.  Flights, however, are being delayed all across the board into D.C. by one of the biggest blizzards on record.  And when Willis spots Army mercenaries in sensitive areas of the airport where nobody is supposed to go, his cop instincts take hold.  As it turns out, these mercenaries are led by a hard-nosed right-wing colonel (William Sadler) whose aim is to snatch a known Latin-American drug dealer (Franco Nero) from the hands of U.S. justice agents.  Their reason, as Sadler puts it, is because he had ""the guts to stand up against Communist aggression.""  To prove his point, Sadler and his minions shut the entire airport down, putting all those planes in the snowbound skies over the nation's capital in mortal peril, until Nero's military plane arrives.  The result is a battle in more ways than one, as Willis must not only tangle with Sadler's gang, but also with an incompetent airport cop (Dennis Franz) who thinks Willis is a lunatic.Very solid acting from Willis, as well as Fred Dalton Thompson and Art Evans, who portray the two sympathetic airport officials, helps DIE HARD 2 remain leagues ahead of the majority of testosterone-laden action flicks. But many of the same flaws that were in DIE HARD 1 creep up here again.  To paint the airport cops as incompetent buffoons just so that Willis can be the hero of the piece is grossly inaccurate and offensive.  Even the media, in the guise of the ultra-obnoxious Dick Thornberg (William Atherton), gets slammed, and not in a very fair or accurate fashion.  And the violence and language in DIE HARD 2 are far more pervasive than the original, with at least two scenes (the icepick to the eye; and Sadler's ex-commander [John Amos] getting sucked into the engine of the getaway 747 at the end) approaching extreme in terms of bloodshed, and the use of the 'F' word approaching SCARFACE in terms of occasions when it is used.Still, there is plenty of suspense and tension to be had here, with the direction of Renny Harlin evincing, at times, the feel of a Spielberg or Peckinpah at their edge-of-the-seat best.  Michael Kamen's score, which interpolates Jean Sibelius' ""Finlandia"" at the end, is also a plus.The verdict is that DIE HARD 2: DIE HARDER is not an unflawed film, but one can certainly do much worse.",Die Hard 2 1990.csv

The directing is fantastic.......The movie takes you into the shoes of Micky and his life and shows all the hardships he undertakes............and it shows you the power of a dream. The females leads do great as well. I just hope Mark Wahlberg gets Oscar this time which he deserves along with Christian Bale. It's an excellent movie overall. Gripping, involving and brave.

TheSquiss,8,33,42,05-Sep-13," A dazzling story of F1, rivalry, respect & cheating death.
","Those who have seen the trailer will know that Rush is the 'Formula 1 film'. The presence of Ron Howard's and Chris Hemsworth's names above the title may put some bums on seats but the fact of it being a film about motor racing will undoubtedly ostracize some potential viewers.So stop right there. Rush is not a movie about motor racing for speed fans any more than Titanic was about sailing for merchant seamen. Rush is a superbly shot, directed, edited and performed film that transcends the sport of motor racing, just as the principal protagonists themselves did almost forty years ago.The rivalry between F1 drivers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel BrÃ¼hl) is common knowledge. Just a couple of minutes trawling through Google's gifts will tell you how many championships each driver won, how they met, how they sparred, how they lived and (nearly) diedÂ… Rush isn't a film that tells you their story. Rush is the film that takes you into their world and shows you how that story unfolded in all its fast, crazy, riotous, dazzling, cynical, brash excess. By the end you may still not want to be an F1 driver or even watch a grand prix, but you sure as hell will wish you could have been there for at least some of the 70s.Howard has provided us with a mixed bag of films over the years with schmaltzy, flicks (A Beautiful Mind), thoughtful biopics (Frost/Nixon), compelling dramas (Apollo 13) and utter twaddle (Angels and Demons). So which category would Rush fall into? The tension Howard creates is ridiculous. Pistons pump, colours blur, the scream of engines deafen us. The editing is so tight it feels as though something will snap. The anticipation prickles the skin and, though we already know what and when, it is almost too much for us to watch it unfold. Technically, Rush verges on exquisite. The digital creation blends flawlessly with the live action and the skids, tumbles, crashes and explosions are horrifying.But it isn't just with the speed and madness around the track where Howard guides perfectly. The hospital scenes when Lauda is treated are almost grotesque. We find ourselves shying away from the visuals, involuntarily grimacing at Lauda's agony even when he demands more pain in order to drive him towards recovery and revenge.Rush boasts one of the finest film scores of the year so far with Hans Zimmer proving why he is among the busiest composers in Hollywood. It's not that the score that makes the film, but it enhances it beautifully, adding emotional colour to the startling visuals to magnify the tension.The joint leads are on impeccable form. Hemsworth portrays Hunt as the playboy we wish we could be (or bed) and his charisma doesn't ooze, it gushes. He is arrogant, cocksure, charming and handsome. He makes it obvious why men wanted Hunt's life and so many women welcomed him into theirs. It is a confident, full performance from Hemsworth that marks him out yet again as an actor with a certain chameleon-like quality and undeniable star power. Immediately we like Hunt but as 123 minutes rush by, he evolves into a flawed man we admire but ultimately decide we don't really want to be and, in some ways, pity. It's a fine performance that engages us on every level.When BrÃ¼hl's (The Edukators, Inglorious Basterds) Lauda strides onto the screen, it is with purpose, his Austrian directness and confidence taken as conceit and arrogance. He does not suffer fools (or almost anyone else) whether they are subordinates, rivals or the men paying for his drive. Supremely confident to the exclusion of social niceties, the Lauda we observe puts our backs up immediately but, just as the Hunt on screen evolves, so, too, does Lauda and by the film's end our allegiance has wavered. It is a sensitive performance from BrÃ¼hl and his understanding of the man he portrays and clear admiration for him infects us thoroughly.Some of the dialogue is lumpy, there are numerous liberties taken with the truth (though not to the extent that U571 completely rewrote history!) and much is glossed over. Howard has perhaps tried too hard to appeal to a mass audience by focusing on the principal women in the drivers' lives, notably Hunt's wife, Suzy (Olivia Wilde) and BrÃ¼hl's, Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). In Marlene's case, she is relatively impactful on her husband's life, suffering through his accident with him. In Suzy's case, however, though she was influential on a period of Hunt's career, it is difficult to see her as anything other than a bystander in his life and yet Howard sees fit to return to her though she is far from his thoughts.These are minor quibbles that make Rush a very good film instead of a 'great'. Nevertheless, my companion for the film who has no interest in motor racing and less knowledge gave a simple summary: ""Excellent."" Me? I'm a fair weather F1 fan. If there is a realistic hope of Button, Hamilton and Di Resta winning or there's been enough hype, I'm there. Otherwise it's Formula what? But, as I wrote, Rush transcends the sport. I was gripped throughout, I gritted my teeth, I gasped, clenched my buttocks and willed the drivers to the finish, on the track, in the hospital and in life.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Rush 2013.csv

phenomynouss,1,16,23,18-Nov-18," luddite fetishization of a coddled man in way over his head
","I found something utterly fascinating in the true story of Christopher McCandless, venturing out into the ""wild"" of Alaska with basically nothing but a gun and some food, and eventually succumbing to the inevitable.
I passed no judgment on him or his decisions when I read through the story, focusing more on the mystery of what drove him to a vagabond existence culminating in total hermitage from which he absolutely could not survive. The clichÃ© of ""the devil is in the details"" is one horribly true here, and tends to tear apart the story.
In truth, McCandless essentially committed suicide. He refused all the necessary help to survive in the cold, did not even learn how to dry meat, and, had he had a map, could have easily walked back to civilization at almost any point in time.
In fact, we can learn almost nothing from McCandless or his time spent in the wild, as his journal entries are as mindless and empty and almost completely devoid of any real content. They literally amount to things like ""Day 2: Fall through the ice day."" ""Day 4: Magic bus day."" ""Day 9: Weakness."" ""Day 10: Snowed in."" ""Day 68: Beaver Dam. Disaster."" ""Day 107 (the last entry): Beautiful berries""
Going into the actual film itself, we get virtually none of this. Instead we are taken on a tediously long, droning journey that covers almost none of the survival aspects and just covers his wandering through the US in the years leading up to the event.
Throughout this ""journey"" we're treated to overly dramatic musical montages waxing poetic on how ""society, man, society is just society, man"" ranting and railing with all the emptiness and incoherence of someone with basic understanding of almost everything, but knowledge of almost nothing.Life sure does sucks for a rich white kid who graduates from a prestigious university with nearly all A's, the movie tells us. How can you be happy with things like money and a job instead of living in the woods, hanging out with psychotically upbeat Danish tourists you meet after barely surviving a dangerous river paddling you jump in with 0 paddling experience, ignoring the guy who tells you you need to sign on with a professional because you could die. What does he know? Society, man. Screw society, man.
The truth about the abuse he and his sister suffered from their parents wasn't revealed publicly by the time his movie was made (though she did disclose it off the record to the book author Jon Krakauer), so it's never made fully explicit here. But the whole theme of the movie is such that it doesn't matter, because it doesn't easily fit into the theme that ""society sucks and you can only be happy living in the woods"".
The immense scale of the romanticization is insufferable. It becomes painfully pretentious almost immediately and it makes the protagonist thoroughly unlikeable; a vapid, empty vessel literally living the dream of the vapid spoiled white kid who worships nature and thinks modern society is a drag. The least I can say about this fictional version of McCandless is he is at least completely devoid of the self-righteous spite and meanness of a character like Holden Caulfield. He's not rubbing our faces in this pretentious message; the film itself is, and sometimes it seems as if he's just as much a victim as we are, having his adventure luridly fetishized as if he were an idol, and not someone who was way in over their head.
I can't help but think of a similar story of someone who died in the Alaska wilderness, Carl McCunn in 1981. He went with almost 2 tons of food and supplies, multiple weapons, and actually left highly detailed journal entries telling a tragic story of a man who made a rather different mistake; He did not make it clear to the pilot who left him in the wilderness to return for him 5 months later. As 5 months slips into 6 months, you can clearly feel the pain in his entries as he realizes he is likely never coming back alive, and no one is likely to come looking for him. At one point, he is even spotted by a state trooper flying over in a plane, but laments in his journal that he apparently accidentally signaled to the trooper that he was okay and not in need of rescue. His final entry is a plea to God to forgive him and look over his family, then writing ""They say it doesn't hurt"" before taking his own life rather than freeze to death.
There's nothing remotely like that in this film. The film barely lingers on Chris's experience of solitude in the wild, preferring to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on with his silly adventures, interspersed with upbeat montage after montage set to popular music",Into the Wild 2007.csv

","Did you ever see a movie that was so brilliant, so creative and ingenious, that you couldn't seem to find the words to fully describe it? Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's how I feel about 2012's ""Wreck-It-Ralph"", an animated film where the whole family can be entertained. Meet Wreck-It-Ralph, a video game villain who's been doing the same act of destroying things in the same video game, in the same video arcade for the last thirty years. Being lonely and wanting to be a good guy for a change, Ralph decides to go on a quest to another game and the results, while chaotic for everyone in the video world, are a total blast for us. On his journey, Ralph encounters a variety of hilarious situations and characters, such as the feisty Vanellope, who like Ralph, also desires to be something different in her candy-coated video world. But they must hurry, for they are being chased by the goofy yet real villain, King Candy as well as an ""Aliens"" inspired infestation of bugs that Ralph inadvertently brings with from another game. Luckily, help comes in the form of a tough as nails warrior, Sergant Calhoun, and from Ralph's game, Fix-It-Felix. There are many things that make this movie worth watching: the fact that the filmmakers are able to really capture the look and feel of the video game world with such fine detail and vivid colors, the inclusion of real video game characters as well as ones who were inspired by real ones, awesome music, but above all, in addition to having plenty of comedy, the movie has heart. Even though the characters may be animated video game characters to begin with, there are still moments where emotion hits you hard, such as the scene where Ralph is tricked into helping King Candy destroy Vanellope's car because he thinks he is doing it for her own good. It gets me every time and that's when you know a film has good writing. But a lot of the credit for the film's success needs to go for the actors who do the voices, such as John C. Reilly as Ralph, Sarah Silverman as Vanellope, Jack McBrayer as Fix-It-Felix, Jane Lynch as Calhoun, and Alan Tudyk as King Candy, plus, a whole lot more. To sum it all up, ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" isn't just for kids; it can be for anyone who used to love going to the arcade, for parents who want to take their kids to a movie that's fun but has an important message, or just for anyone who might need a good laugh.

Bravesfan17,9,0,0,22-May-10," Apatow makes a funny movie with a good message
","Writer-director Judd Apatow has shown some brilliant work with his directing debut in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. His sophomoric work in Knocked Up trumps that as he shows how much he has progressed as a writer and director. He has shown some great directing in setting up the scene and have us get to know who these characters are and how they change.We start out with Seth Rogen as Ben Stone, a guy who likes to hang out with his buddies, drink beer, and smoke crack. Apatow then shows us Katherine Heigl as Allison Scott, a high achieving E! employee who is moving up in the ranks and is asked to become a reporter. Both of our leads in Rogen and Heigl show us how brilliant they are at playing these polar opposite people. Rogen gives a breakthrough performance that made him famous. Heigl shows that she can do a leading comedic role and I find it hard to believe this role went through dozens of actresses before it landed on Heigl.Ben's friends are a lot like him. They also like to get drunk, stoned, and are a fun-loving bunch. Allison's relatives are a lot like her in the sense that they are responsible.Things come unglued when Ben and his friends are at a club the same night that Allison and her sister Debbie are there. Ben and Allison meet and hit it off. They enjoy a one night stand together and don't see each other for eight weeks. At this time we find out that Allison is pregnant with Ben's child.This causes Ben to take an even greater interest in Allison and make him act more mature. He starts to make a crossover from being a stoner to being a responsible guy. Later, we find out that Ben hasn't been as responsible as we thought when we find out that Ben stashed away the books about going through life when expecting a baby. After a crazy weekend in Vegas, Ben decides to actually be responsible with his life and try to win back Allison. Ben moves out of the house from his buddies, gets a legitimate job, and reads the books so he knows what to expect with Allison. Allison takes him back, gives birth to a baby girl, and moves in with Ben.Writer-director Judd Apatow knows how to make good heartfelt comedies with characters who we as an audience can relate to. I also like that despite the raunchiness and content of his movies, he can send out a good message. With Knocked Up, Apatow shows that any ordinary guy can get a hot girl.",Knocked Up 2007.csv

MadEden,9,3,7,21-Jan-13," Too much drama for history, and too much history for drama
","This is a peculiar film. And an important one. Zero Dark Thrity is one of those films that has to be done. If Kathryn Bigelow hadn't done it, someone will. There will be many ways to tell this story - or shall we call it history? It can be easily imagined that there be a documentary about it, and just as easily imagined a big patriotic Hollywood action picture about it. Zero Dark Thirty is neither. And for the atmosphere and mood created by this film, we should feel much grateful to Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal. Most of the time the film possesses a quiet, reserved attitude. In the opening sequence about 9/11 - which is perhaps bound to be another classic scene in film history - all we could hear is screaming and yelling and reporting and talking; there was no image, for the entire scene. In the final take-down sequence, there was no triumphant and emotional music; there was, in fact, almost no sign of victory at all. There was only the dark (or green) images, running after, with, and alongside soldiers. In the end, there wasn't even one frontal shot of Osama Bin Laden's face. We could not feel triumph. We weren't supposed to.In this aspect, Zero Dark Thirty is quite similar to Lincoln. Both are made by master filmmakers, both tell stories that are more or less known by everyone, and both succeeded in not looking cheesy by exhibiting exceptional reservation.Both the camera and the music were masterfully handled. The cinematography is still hand-held documentary style, but this time it's well done. Where The Hurt Locker had overdone it to such a degree that the cinematography just distracted and annoyed, Zero Dark Thirty did just right.Music was also reserved and appropriate. At the supposedly most exciting moments, there were, however, no music underlining the triumphant emotions. When it requires it, as in the helicopter scenes before the final operation, it is there.Sadly, although the filmmaking of Zero is splendid, the film is not. Zero is not exactly a film; it is too restrained by history. What ended up on the screen is not really a story, but mere segments of history told in chronological order. Compiling a film with segments instead of one whole story is nothing wrong in itself: Wong Kar Wai always does that, from Days of Being Wild to The Grandmaster. Quentin did that. But between these segments there must be connection: they may be connected by theme, by character, by parallel stories, by something.In Zero Dark Thirty that connection is history and character. But the history connection is weak, the character connection weaker. Zero's story is Hunting for Bin Laden. And it did that, recounting events from 2001 to 2011. But what exactly does that offer? What depth does the film go into except that of a history textbook?Of course, criticism on a film must consider the film's intention. If all Zero aspired to be is a history textbook, then we need not question its depth of story. However, it is evident that Zero is not history. As has been criticized by only too many, Zero has put all its focus and almost all the credits onto one woman, Maya. For history, Zero is too personal,Yet it is not personal enough. Despite all the focus and all her screen time, Maya, as a character, makes us feel no more intimate or connected to her at the end than we did at the beginning of the film. We did not see a development through the story. We didn't really care. All we saw was a persistent hero. Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal has made up quite a bit of non-historic drama, but they didn't nearly make enough. So I can't help but ask myself, again and again: What exactly is the point of this film? You might answer: there is no point, and it's just history. But for that there is too much drama. And if it's trying to make a point as a drama - well, can't see any.",Zero Dark Thirty 2012.csv

","One of the reasons I like this film is because it takes place in my backyard, so to speak. I happen to live in the area where it was filmed and that's one of the reasons I enjoy watching it. Having said that, and being a Hitchcock fan, I definitely don't think this was anywhere up to his standards.I don't expect there to be a reason given for the bird attacks. That's a mystery and will remain one. What I can't get behind are some of the incredibly cheesy situations and silly dialogue. The conversation between Melanie and Annie for instance, after Melanie returns from having dinner with Mitch and his family. Annie goes into this whole explanation of Lydia's character and why she behaves the way she does. Yet, she says, Lydia is not a jealous, possessive mother????? When she relates her own experiences with Mitch and Lydia, Melanie makes the comment 'that adds up to a jealous possessive mother', or something along those lines. 'No', says Annie, she's not afraid of losing Mitch, she's just afraid of being abandoned'. Did I miss something here? I can't believe that Hitchcock allowed such senseless, pointless dialogue between his characters.Later Annie is found dead in front of her house, yet she manages to push Cathy inside, and Cathy doesn't have a scratch on her. Okay, maybe there is a way this could have happened but it does stretch the imagination a bit. Speaking of Cathy, I found the kid to be irritating beyond words. Fortunately for her, Veronica Cartwright's acting has greatly improved in the intervening years but she sure couldn't act in this film.Nevertheless, I find this film to be enjoyable and I watch it time and again.

","I haven't read the original novella by King. One of the few people who seems able to make the authors stuff work well on screen without dramatically altering it is Darabont, and for how much this is essentially a gross-out B-movie with monsters, he largely does do pretty well. Stephen is the literary equivalent to fast food; he even admits so, himself. Why he is so celebrated is an enigma I don't expect to find the answer to. Hey; this manages an isolation, ""we're trapped!"" kind of thing, and it does so without losing our attention. That deserves, nay, *demands*, props. There are a couple of good, fleshed out characters. It strives to show truths about humanity, though its chance at doing so gradually fades away in the face of the shrill tone of the sides in conflict. Not to mention the audience's exposure to an intolerable religious nut, who'll frustrate atheists and believers(well, Christian ones, at least) alike. The acting varies, particularly that of the kid, who goes back and forth between being natural and lacking credibility. Jane carries it nicely, and those that are given a lot to do usually live up to the challenge. This provides jump scares and a couple of exciting bits, and there is some decent tension here and there. The quality of the FX ranges, and the integration of CGI elements with live-action is hit and miss, too. Designs aren't bad, though obviously not everyone will consider these creatures to be intimidating(I didn't, to be honest). There is plenty of bloody, gory violence, a lot of disturbing content and infrequent strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of the writer. 7/10",The Mist 2007.csv
mjjusa-1,6,1,4,26-Nov-07," Twilight Zone revisited
","I have not read the novella nor have I read a Stephen King book in years. I wondered as I watched this movie whether his serious accident had changed his life view dramatically. Whether the unfairness of his injuries and the random nature of his personal tragedy had changed his view of religion and religious people. Because beyond the mist and its denizens there are monstrous Christians portrayed as murderous fanatics and warped psychopaths used as curious plot devices among the humans trapped and trying to survive.The religious discussions go on and on as if in a reworked 'Lions for Lambs.' We are made to feel as if the irrationality of literal biblical interpretation is somehow more irrational than a plot involving creatures from another dimension with a taste for humans. But, the movie as a movie works as a long familiar Twilight Zone plot...you know: group dynamics in the face of inexplicable events. I kept waiting for the camera to pull back and reveal the entire plot as some evil experiment to determine human breaking points.It isn't really a scary film, more of a tense film. The misty monsters become almost familiar and fill familiar roles right down to living human pupae acting as grotesque hosts of grotesque spidery thingees. But, it is a confusing menagerie of evil insects with no natural order to them...some are like demented wasps, others refugees from prehistoric times, and a few are huge and lurch around making noises and looking like War of the Worlds machines. Some of the acting seemed false to me especially the interaction of father to child and the burgeoning romance between father and the new teacher in town played out while the mother/wife has been lost in the mist.The ending is shocking and is a Frank Darabontian addition rather than King's idea of a proper conclusion. I'll let others determine whether the religious caricatures spring from King's loss of faith during his painful recovery, are a comment on current events, or are as much overkill as the overkill of the ending.Well worth my $6.50 matinÃ©e price but I might have felt cheated at premium rates. Seemed totally over the top in its anti religion bias to this agnostic but former altar boy.

GirishGowda,7,3,4,15-Mar-12," The Observers.. um, Adjusters, are watching you!
","Are the choices we make really made on our own free will or is it all fate, predestined and set in stone no matter how hard we try to escape it? In ""The Adjustment Bureau"", a rising politician, David Norris (Matt Damon) bumps into a ballerina, Elise (Emily Blunt) in the strangest of places under the strangest of circumstances and they are immediately attracted to each other. Even though mysterious men (The Adjusters) are dead set on keeping them apart, they keep bumping into each other by chance. Finally, one of the stranger mysterious guys kidnap him and lay it all in front of him. They are the course correctors of the world. Whenever they hand over free will to humans from the heights of human advancements, we inevitably decline into anarchy, the Dark Ages and world wars. He realizes the gravity of the situation where his and Elise's entire starlit future will no longer be a possibility if they fall in love. In the face of overwhelming odds, either he must let her go and accept his fate or risk everything to be with her and push their career into an abyss.People who haven't watched 'Fringe' are calling this movie imaginative and intriguing, while I'd say its derivative of a far greater work. The Adjustment Bureau in the movie is quite obviously fashioned along the lines of Fringe's ""OBSERVERS"". The differences being the notable not-balded heads, the use of 'portal doors' and The Adjusters being more or less angels. The Observers though, are obviously much more better written than The Adjusters who seem very non-threatening. Implying God as the Chairman was really funny to me. It made the movie less suspenseful than it should have been. Then there's a plot deviation in the middle when its revealed that David and Elise were meant to be together in all the previous plans, but the plan was changed suddenly. So, now they were meant to be with different people. This brings up the whole - Why the hell did the Chairman change the plan in the first place!! Thus, David and Elise, when you think about it, never had any free will to fall in love with each other since the remnants of the previous plans were subconsciously in their minds.Most people are comparing this movie to Inception which is highly unfair since its not an all out intelligent action/sci-fi thriller. But, if this is the kind of stories 'Inception' helps bring about in Hollywood, then its a step in the right direction. Let me be clear, I really liked the movie, but the potential it had was never quite achieved. Why did the Adjustors want humans to have a better life? What was their interest in all this? It was never explained. They didn't delve into the philosophical or sci-fi aspects of the story. The first half was far superior to the latter half of the movie. Also it didn't help with the fact that the gorgeous Emily Blunt is just the arm candy for Matt Damon and is completely under utilized, barring a few scenes. Matt Damon is perfect in his portrayal as always. By far, the breakout character being the Adjuster, Harry (Anthony Mackie) who goes against the rules and helps David Norris in his quest. In retrospect, his was the only arc where the philosophical and moral conundrum in following God's plans was even remotely touched upon (same storyline is done better in 'Supernatural'). This movie is just another 'love triumphs over all hardships' with a sci-fi/supernatural twist. Could have been done better, but its enjoyable nonetheless.7/10",The Adjustment Bureau 2011.csv

","In Philadelphia, the former UN Investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and their two daughters, Rachel and Constance, are trapped in the traffic jam. Out of the blue, they witness several car crashes caused by the attack of hordes of zombies. Gerry runs with his family and he steals and drives a RV, heading to Newark, New Jersey. Gerry calls his old friend, UN Secretary General Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), who promises to send a helicopter on the next morning to rescue Gerry and his family. Gerry stops at a supermarket to get supplies and medicine for his asthmatic daughter and the RV is stolen. They flee to an apartment building and a Latin family helps them, lodging the family in their apartment.On the next morning, Gerry invites the family to go with them to the roof, but they prefer to stay in their apartment. However they are attacked by zombies and the boy Tommy joins Gerry and his family in their runaway. The helicopter brings them to an aircraft carrier anchored offshore New York City and Gerry is assigned to travel to South Korea with the virologist Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel)to seek out the patient zero to develop a vaccine. When the team arrives at the base, they are attacked by zombies and Fassbach panics and has a fatal accident. Gerry has a conversation with an insane ex-CIA agent (David Morse) that is imprisoned and he goes to Jerusalem to talk to the Director of Mossad Jurgen Warmbrunn (Ludi Boeken) to learn why he built a wall and transformed the city in a safe zone. When Jerusalem is attacked by a horde of zombies, Gerry observes that the zombies do not attack terminally ill persons. Now he travels with his escort Segen (Daniella Kertesz) to a research facility in Wales to disclose his findings to the scientists. ""World War Z"" is a refreshing zombie movie, with a tense story full of action. I know that the movie is not faithful to the novel, but the plot is a combination of zombies and virus movies and entertains. The characters are likable and the special effects are top-notch. Matthew ""Jack Shepherd"" Fox is wasted with a minor role but in accordance with a research in internet, his character would have an important role in ""World War Z"", having an affair with Gerry's wife and taking care of his family during his journey seeking a cure to the epidemic. The dark ending, with Karin trading her body to survive, was changed by Paramount to a commercial (and probably better) conclusion.

homespun13,3,5,9,16-Jun-13," Did not rise to its potential
","I enjoyed historical movies and in general find the life of a priceless antique worth reading about (or watching). I find it amazing that we can know every owner for example of a specific pearl going back several centuries, but most folks know about their own families usually just two generations back. So I thought this movie would be one I would enjoy. I also expected to hear some beautiful violin music. Wrong on both counts. The violin's history seemed too manufactured for the film's sake, not a real logical progression from one owner to another. Some of the major changes of ownership were left to the viewer's imagination and at least in my own case, I was unable to make the leap. The change did not make sense. How did the violin get to be owned by gypsies? How did it get to China? It would have made an interesting story, but where the manufactured history is stretched way beyond anything credible, the change of ownership is simply not explained. While I liked the overall concept of following the life of an object, the music, which I expected to be a major part of this film, was beyond disappointing. I don't play the violin but I can certainly appreciate beautiful music. There was very little ""music"" per se in this music. The only time anything that could be called ""music"" was played was some Chinese children's performance and it was made by accordions. The only sounds we heard coming from this supposedly incredibly valuable violin was the endless screeching, and this in spite of the fact that its journey took us through times when some of the most heavenly music on earth had been composed. Not one piece from Mozart, or resembling Mozart's style, had been offered. Just screeching. No music of any of the music's great composers was played at any time. More screeching. The sounds this violin made could have been compared to a cat scratching on a metal roof. That bad. Wonder how many CDs with the soundtrack they managed to sell. That would tell them just how ""wonderful"" the soundtrack was. The soundtrack was thoroughly modern, something that may be considered all the rage today. The music was probably difficult to play, but there is no sugarcoating it - the music is nothing but screeching. No melody, no rhythm, no emotion. No sweet sounds that leave a person in awe of beauty of sound. So no music, just noise. The ending climax likewise is not really any surprise like it is supposed to be, and most certainly not a shocking surprise, because I thought ""the secret"" was already implied in the beginning and so it didn't seem like any kind of surprise, at least not to me. If you can stand the noise that passes for a soundtrack, this is not a bad film. It's different. It's not very entertaining, but just the fact that it doesn't follow the standard mold makes it interesting. Best film ever made (as some of the reviews here indicate)? Most definitely not. I am writing this in 2013 (saw the film for the first time yesterday) and the film is all but forgotten today, 15 years after it was made.

MaximumMadness,10,0,3,08-Dec-07," ""Knocked Up"" is a delightful gem of comedy, romance and drama! One of the best films in years!
","Judd Apatow, director of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", has finally achieved something many modern comedic filmmakers attempt, and fail at fully attaining... He has crafted a silly, fun, touching and heartwarming movie that manages to deliver the goods ten-fold, with a tale that is relevant and astonishingly well-made.""Knocked Up"" tells the story of rising career-woman Alison (played by the very charming Katherine Heigl), whom has just been informed by her superiors that she is ready to do on-camera work. (She currently works as an assistant at the E! channel) With her sister Debbie (played by Leslie Mann, in a cute but feisty performance) by her side, she celebrates by going clubbing and having a fun time, as many would. However, on this fateful night, she meets the goof-ball Ben (played with perfection by Seth Rogan), an obnoxious but good-hearted slacker with no job, who lives with four stoner friends.Despite being polar opposites, the booze gets the better of them, and they end up in a one night stand. After having something of a falling out the next morning (Alison is slightly bothered by Ben's blunt, anything-goes attitude) they part ways.Some weeks later, Alison realizes she is pregnant, and the movie is off. After finding out, Ben goes through the round of emotions... He is angry... He is nervous... He worries... But he decides that it is his responsibility to help Alison, and support her decision to keep the baby.From there on in, it is a tale of companionship, romance and emotion... Ben and Alison slowly begin to fall in love with one another, but their circumstances (and misunderstandings) threaten to tear them apart. Interstingly, we also get a somewhat-similar parallel story happening, in which Debbie and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd), whom are married with children, go through a slew of emotions... the tolls of marriage looming over them.What makes the film work for me, and so many others who love it, is the fact that it all feels real to a degree. Unlike other comedies, which will exaggerate situations and jokes, everything feels natural in this film. I could honestly see this very story happening in real life... (Which it did, in part... As portions of the film were based on the pregnancy of Leslie Mann, whom is married to writer/director Apatow.) And the superb acting doesn't hurt, either. Rogan is charming as Ben, and you can clearly see he is struggling with his decisions... He obviously has a fairly good life, living with his best friends, his only work being the current construction of a pseudo-pornographic website... But he has to grow up.Heigle is also spectacular... She makes us feel for her in ways that many actresses cannot, and I suspect she is going to become one of the greatest young actresses of this time.Mann and Rudd are both a wonderful addition to the story, giving an interesting perspective on the situation by people who have ""been there, done that"" with kids and pregnancy, and the Debbie/Alison relationship fits right in, not feeling forced.And the comedy, though vulgar, is very funny, and never subtracts from the story.Finally, before I wrap up, let me just say that the small, cameo-esquire rolls by a number of pop-culture icons (including Ryan Seacrest in a hilarious rant) and the addition of Harold Ramis as Ben's father were nice touches.""Knocked Up"" is one of those rare films that will have you doubled-over from laughter consistently, while at the same time (and I'm sorry, I know I sound stupid saying this) tugging at you inside. It is a sweet portrayal of responsibility and love, and a rare treat.Plus, the hilarious gross-out and insult humor, and some brief instances of celebrity nudity (as seen on the guys' TV) doesn't hurt either.10 out of 10",Knocked Up 2007.csv

","I'm hardly the first to mention it, but it should be known by any potential viewer; the title being just is not in any way, shape or form as threatening herein as in the first two(which right there takes a chunk of the appeal, and proceeds to burn it to cinders). There's also really no atmosphere, not one that could unnerve anyone but the most easily intimidated, anyway, which further eliminates reasons we watched the prior entries. So what *do* we have? Well, the Fincher touch(though it should be known that he disowned it, and clearly with good cause) is there, somewhat. We're treated to Giger doing more design work. The score certainly isn't bad. Some of the writing isn't awful(and, not unlike the other sequels, it didn't exactly have a great start-off point, so let's give it at least a little slack... but let's keep to the pocket-knife for the cutting of it for now), if there are lines that... really couldn't work no matter how well they had been delivered. Anyway, I was on the positives of this; Ripley is still consistent, and Henriksen is back(if his performance is... shall we say ""overplayed"", to put it nicely). Some of the effects are the best yet of the series(others... not so much). The plot isn't all that interesting(oh dear, we're back at the criticisms), if it does have an idea or two that give the whole thing some merit(as well as characters and back-stories fit for something done by David). The Special Edition/Assembled Cut(not Director's Cut) adds scenes, some of which of lesser technical quality(but hardly a major bother, if one is up for watching more), which I would suggest for anyone who want to give this another chance(I enjoyed some of the new it brought about). In the end, I'm afraid I just find it more and more difficult and unsatisfying to actually sit down for the one hour and forty five minutes that this lasts before the ending credits start on their usual, anticipated roll(they really ought to jump, maybe do a little dance(...get down tonight), you know, mix it up a little) with each viewing.

This film was special to me for two reasons. I had a chorus teacher in high school had affected me in such a way as Mr. Holland did his students. And years later I had the opportunity to work with and teach Drama to young people from age six up. I have seen this story from both sides, and it still affects me so very much. My only argument with the film is in the final scene. If the Governor was so dedicated to Mr. Holland why did she not do something about retaining the music program in that school?

In fact the director gives us some clues that sergeant Bob Lee Swagger is called out for this aim. But the film turns to a different shape differing from ""Jackal"". Bob Lee Swagger who is fighting for USA in Africa is now in his house to seclude himself because of losing his partner in Africa. He is deceived with the feeling of patriotism and he is wanted to develop a possible assassination plan to the president to prevent the real one. Colonel lsaac Johnson who is inside dirty works in Africa with a high level senator Charles Meachum persuades Swagger. Swagger works for that in such manners which will make him number one suspicious after the assassination. In fact assassination isn't against the president, it is against headpriest of an African's country because of the wish of destroying assassination reasons. Like everyone Swagger doesn't realise the real fact and moreover he is charged with the assassination because of his perfect assassination plan and he finds himself in a well-designed trap.The technical details got me amazed and I especially admire visual effects producer. According to me starting and finishing scenes are very important for a film to deserve good comments. ""Shooter"" already deserves that. I think Antoine Fuqua did a good job with ""Shooter"" and I will be waiting for the other ones to follow his line. Musics are also so creative.Let me talk to some players. As I said above Mark Wahlberg dominates almost the whole film. I don't remember such a film that Wahlberg completely carried it to the summit himself. But it is unjustice not to talk about Danny Glover's performance. As Colonel lsaac Johnson, Danny Glover really does his best. Michael Pena also fits in with beginner agent role and his role's form changes after assassination.Pointing my words, I touch on gun specialist's, crippled man's and Senator's talkings.

Because, there was no mass-destruction weapons in Iraq where people are hungry appeared during the invasion. Abu-Ghraib is not a terrorist capturing central where most innocent people is jailed.

You can't just have a main character die in a movie and not tell how it happened like the book does, or just say oh the dragon is dead someone killed it...If you had 1 movie the scenes would have been extremely short and rushed like the book was These 3 movies gave him creative reign to develop a richer story around the theme and characters of the book, rather than the empty/quick feeling the ending of the book had on its loose ends, and in that case it stayed very true to the theme or overall message the book had.

No doubt that this film is excellent, it is a work of art. However, it seems that the latest audiences have more difficulty in enjoy this film, given the lack of the colorful and vividness of the actual computerized effects and cinematography. They have to understand that this film has been done in a given period, with all the available techniques at the time. And if they understand this well, they're more easily able to admire it. In fact, although the picture is quite different from what we are used to actually, it's still very well done.

I'd rather watch a movie starring Steve Guttenberg as Brooklyn's best kept Streetball secret, with NBA pipe dreams. ""Who's with me, who's with me.""",Jerry Maguire 1996.csv

","I decided to watch this movie after looking at the reviews on IMDb. Firstly, how on earth can someone rate this movie more than 1 out of 10? This is by far the slowest ever movie in existence. And never before have I seen a movie with no meaningful storyline what so ever.The acting was diabolical, the plot is as dry as a southern Arizona prune plucked in the prime of July, the suspense... what suspense? How this movie received such positive ratings by reputable critics, let alone the laymen, has left me dumbfounded! People like AK have commented on just how brilliant this movie is, but honestly, take it from me, it is a waste of two hours of your life.In my honest opinion, a slug race is faster than this movie, and if you truly value your time, then steer clear of this movie!!!",Drive 2011.csv
